I have to decide where we're going, what we're doing, what time HE has to get up and ready, if we eat..where we eat, etc. It's exhausting and I've told him before. \n\nThat being said, I'm now a correctional officer.

And I\u2019m just exhausted with having to choose or help choose stuff. I\u2019m hitting a wall with my dress and I just keep waffling.\n\nI\u2019m petite (5\u20191) with not much curves. I find I need my waist line defined to not get lost in the head to toe all one colour (I normally prefer short dresses or skirt and top). My widest point is at my shoulders. For all these reasons I\u2019ve been looking at a-line dresses but not very large heavy ones.\n\nMy wedding will be in the spring in a garden and I\u2019m going for a relaxed but fun vibe, with scadinadian midsummer inspiration.\n\nFirst 2 dresses are the same, with and without detachable sleeves. Last two are a more fitted silhouette for comparison but I think I mostly eliminated them.\n\nThank you so much for your help!!!",

I find I need my waist line defined to not get lost in the head to toe all one colour (I normally prefer short dresses or skirt and top). My widest point is at my shoulders. For all these reasons I\u2019ve been looking at a-line dresses but not very large heavy ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wedding will be in the spring in a garden and I\u2019m going for a relaxed but fun vibe, with scadinadian midsummer inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First 2 dresses are the same, with and without detachable sleeves. Last two are a more fitted silhouette for comparison but I think I mostly eliminated them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your help!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We are going on a New England Princess cruise next October.\n\nAnyway, I am hitting real decision fatigue on the cabin.\n\nTypically I would go for an interior.

Just a bed.\n\nAn upgrade to the deluxe balcony with a sofa is $1,500 extra. That\u2019s a hefty price tag for a sofa\u2026 but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around a 7 day trip with nowhere to sit in the room. That\u2019s a lot of money that could be going to another cruise!\n\nWe are introverts who will not be out partying all night. I imaging myself wanting to sit on the couch while waiting for her to get ready, enjoy a cup of coffee in the room in the morning, and probably be back in the room a few hours after dinner to wind down with a glass of wine before bed. Just seems like the sofa would create a very comfortable place for all that.\n\nBut\u2026 is the reality that there are plenty of places outside the room to relax and be introverted? I know some people say the are only in their rooms to sleep and shower, but I would think there are also those who do enjoy being in their rooms more.\n\nSo I guess my real question is: are there any introverts out there who do enjoy relaxing in their rooms during a cruise? Are you content with an interior cabin, or is the splurge worth it for a larger room/balcony?",

I deleted the post because after a few days, I realized that even though it was close to perfect, it wasn't scratching that itch.\n\nI think a lot of it is in part due to seeing so many other options I keep seeing and wanting to try (I know it\u2019s a lack of discipline - BUT I WANT THEM ALL!!). Though I am thinking of getting a solid pen that lets me use various refills (e.g. Zebra Sarasa Grand Gel) - I\u2019ll pause for a (likely brief) moment.\n\nI know the best solution would be to go to a big stationary store and try them all out, and I will need to find some in my city.\n\nI write all of this to say, anyone else in the same boat? I\u2019d love to hear about it!\n\n[Current Stack\\/ Rotation: I have either been given or have had for a while! I love these and they are great, but don\u2019t scratch that itch.](https://preview.redd.it/whet6vskizod1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eaf93d0d722d016f10a0076a8907d19d29f3360)\n\n",

I deleted the post because after a few days, I realized that even though it was close to perfect, it wasn&amp;#39;t scratching that itch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of it is in part due to seeing so many other options I keep seeing and wanting to try (I know it\u2019s a lack of discipline - BUT I WANT THEM ALL!!). Though I am thinking of getting a solid pen that lets me use various refills (e.g. Zebra Sarasa Grand Gel) - I\u2019ll pause for a (likely brief) moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the best solution would be to go to a big stationary store and try them all out, and I will need to find some in my city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I write all of this to say, anyone else in the same boat? I\u2019d love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/whet6vskizod1.jpg?width=3024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7eaf93d0d722d016f10a0076a8907d19d29f3360\"&gt;Current Stack/ Rotation: I have either been given or have had for a while!

He's Asian American, and I'm a South Asian immigrant.\n\nHere's the backstory: my family has been pushing for an arranged marriage for the past 2 years, but I've always believed in finding genuine connections. I was single for 3 years before meeting my boyfriend.\n\nMy bf on the other hand comes from background where marriage after 35 is common\n\nAfter a month, I asked for exclusivity, though he seemed more invested. Six months in, I said \"I love you\" first, despite knowing he showed it through actions. Three months in, I opened up about my family's involvement in my marriage prospects, and he assured me of his commitment to our relationship and I stopped entertaining my family. \n\nAfter 1 year and 8 months, we agreed on a timeline to marry when I turn 30. However, with my work permit issues looming I am leaving the country. He hasn't initiated any conversation about our future. I've dropped hints and nudged him to discuss engagement or marriage, but he hasn't shown any excitement.\n\nEverytime I bring this topic up he says that he really wants to marry me, we\u2019re a good team and that he will be better at communicating. \n\nI turn 30 in 8 months, and I'm at a crossroads. I'm ready for commitment, but he seems like he is not ready. He's not emotionally expressive and struggles with decisions, though he's hardworking and respectful.\n\nI'm torn between my love for him and my desire for a committed future. Is this just decision fatigue, or is there something deeper? I love him and can't see a future with anyone else. Any advice or insights would be appreciated.",

He&amp;#39;s Asian American, and I&amp;#39;m a South Asian immigrant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the backstory: my family has been pushing for an arranged marriage for the past 2 years, but I&amp;#39;ve always believed in finding genuine connections. I was single for 3 years before meeting my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bf on the other hand comes from background where marriage after 35 is common&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a month, I asked for exclusivity, though he seemed more invested. Six months in, I said &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; first, despite knowing he showed it through actions. Three months in, I opened up about my family&amp;#39;s involvement in my marriage prospects, and he assured me of his commitment to our relationship and I stopped entertaining my family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 1 year and 8 months, we agreed on a timeline to marry when I turn 30. However, with my work permit issues looming I am leaving the country. He hasn&amp;#39;t initiated any conversation about our future. I&amp;#39;ve dropped hints and nudged him to discuss engagement or marriage, but he hasn&amp;#39;t shown any excitement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime I bring this topic up he says that he really wants to marry me, we\u2019re a good team and that he will be better at communicating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turn 30 in 8 months, and I&amp;#39;m at a crossroads. I&amp;#39;m ready for commitment, but he seems like he is not ready. He&amp;#39;s not emotionally expressive and struggles with decisions, though he&amp;#39;s hardworking and respectful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m torn between my love for him and my desire for a committed future. Is this just decision fatigue, or is there something deeper? I love him and can&amp;#39;t see a future with anyone else. Any advice or insights would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My goal is to save money and increase productivity so I have more time/money for things that add to my life, so not necessarily cutting down but redirecting my priorities. \n\nI feel like material-wise, I've found a good balance. I've been doing a lot of decluttering and found that keeping one good thing for one purpose has been such a game changer and I feel so relieved. I was always a hoarder who liked the idea of options, but I always wanted to save my precious belongings and ended up wasting everything, but at the same time always wanting new (eg. skincare products). I realized that hoarding is what weighed me down from getting newer and better. Of course I am not giving up my closet, but I've become extra conscious about what I decide to spend on. I've started disliking gifts because I don't really want extra items in my house anymore haha.\n\nNow it's my routine that I feel like are cluttered in my brain. I don't know if it's maybe just because I'm in a transition phase in my life, but I feel like my living space always becomes a mess until my weekly clean, and I hate the build up. I feel like there are small daily things that I should do to be proactive that but it's so exhausting sometimes. My daily schedule is also not super consistent with work, so I feel like I'm having a hard time adapting to a routine that feels productive and cannot maintain good habits, especially on my days off. Same with messages/emails; I always procrastinate reading and responding because it all feels so mentally heavy. I was always on top of things in school so maybe I'm just burnt out after 8 years of university?\n\nIs there anything you do for a productive routine in terms of reducing decision fatigue? ",

How do other people cope?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many other people who pursue financial independence, I enjoy planning things. While I'm old enough now to know that \"the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry\", I've always been someone who enjoys thinking about what my available options are, deciding what I want and how to go about it, and making that happen over the medium or long-term. This has been a helpful trait in pursuing FI, and I'm glad to be inclined in this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever...I'm finding in the past couple years that I'm almost stressed out by all the additional options for what to do with my life that pursuing FI has given me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young, I felt that I had few options except to roll up my sleeves and grind it out in my choice of career - it was my only way of getting a financial base and building a life for myself. I didn't have an impoverished upbringing or anything, but I did have parents who maybe didn't have the best mindset about money. I wanted a career and I wanted financial stability in a way that they didn't really believe was possible. So, to me, the choice was simple - \"work and build wealth\" as much as I could in order to build a future for myself, or \"be careless and build nothing\", living from hand-to-mouth and not building any sort of future. For me, the choice was obvious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, years later, we have a solid financial base in our lives. We will certainly be able to retire early if we choose, and we can combine that with some other fun adventures if we are smart about it. However, while I'm incredibly grateful to have the opportunities I have, I increasingly feel overwhelmed by all the things I COULD choose to do with my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I stay in my job another 5 years, or another 10 years, or another 15 years? Should I stay in my career and keep grinding it out, or try to pursue any passion projects? Should I try to write a book? Should I take a sabbatical and travel around the world? Should I stay in my city or move to the country? Should I get a vacation house? Should I try to leave the country during the colder months ever year? (I'm in Canada, winters are cold.) Should I look at getting a bigger house? A custom house? A smaller house? What do I want???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of this is just human psychology - I think of [Dan Gilbert's TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_surprising_science_of_happiness) on happiness, and how having more options to choose from can be a source of stress. The whole idea that the company that sells three kinds of jam will sell more jam than the company that makes seventeen kinds of jam. I also enjoyed [Mark Manson's book](https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art), and agree with his conclusion that people don't have this \"one passion\" in their lives that they need to be \"true to\" - there are many things we can do with our lives and there will always be upsides and downsides to whatever path we choose, and it's important to accept and be OK with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've gotten my head around all that, but I'm still having trouble with strategies to cope with all of the new decisions that pursuing FI allows you to make. To other people pursuing FI - do you sometimes get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of options available in your life? If so, how do you keep your journey focused? How do you decide on one course of action and not get overwhelmed with the dozen other things that you could also do instead?",

I loved it because I love finding a use for old cards, or just bad cards, that are basically unplayable now. Cards like \\[\\[briar shield\\]\\], \\[\\[carapace\\]\\], or \\[\\[faith healer\\]\\] would probably be worthless in any other deck (or at least, most other decks) but are great for this one. One of the best cards in the deck was \\[\\[unbridled growth\\]\\]. Keep in mind, this is before Commander Masters, and I was trying to keep the deck under $100, and there were still around 200+ cards I wanted to include in the deck. Getting down to 100 cards was incredibly hard.\n\nThen Commander Masters comes out, and introduces new cards that I now *need* for the deck like \\[\\[Nyxborn Behemoth\\]\\], and makes a bunch of other cards that were previously out of my budget now includable due to reprints.\n\nIt also introduced \\[\\[Narci\\]\\], and I wanted to make a similar build for her but not using any sagas, which I\u2019m calling \u201cNarci\u2019s Novellas\u201d - since I feel like a novella is the opposite of a saga. Again, the deck has 200+ cards that I\u2019d like to include if I could.\n\nThen comes Wilds, which introduces the bargain mechanic, which slots into the archetype nicely, and another crapton of cards that I want to include, like \\[\\[Archon of the Wild Rose\\]\\], \\[\\[Slumbering Keepguard\\]\\], and \\[\\[Timber Paladin\\]\\], and even more reprints of cards I would\u2019ve included before but couldn\u2019t afford to. I'm also now building \\[\\[Eriette\\]\\] and \\[\\[Yenna\\]\\], and I was honestly hoping that dropping down to 2-colors would make my decisions easier, but it didn\u2019t really help much.\n\nI\u2019m now considering asking my playgroup to allow me to up the deck size, which I think they\u2019ll be fine with, but I kind of hate how I feel when I bend the rules, even though it\u2019ll just make my decks worse (if anyone actually wants to try a milling-out strategy, or something else where my deck size would actually benefit me, I would just play a different deck).\n\nAnyone else feeling similarly?\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: to people offering suggestions, I was just venting! But thx anyway",

And if I ask anyone, they say I should do what I want or what feels best, etc. I don\u2019t want to be validated, I want practical advice. Or even a debate so I can solidify a choice. I don\u2019t have a partner to discuss with, but even when I did he was more useless than my pet rock. \n\n\n I have never found it so difficult. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, and told menopause exasperates it. Or maybe this is something others in menopause face that are not ND. \n\n\nSo any advice on how to tackle this? Maybe one of you have a coping strategy I can use. I\u2019m desperate.",

This color or that color? Keep or give away? Do I really need this? This side or that side? Too much? Too little? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate it. And if I ask anyone, they say I should do what I want or what feels best, etc. I don\u2019t want to be validated, I want practical advice. Or even a debate so I can solidify a choice. I don\u2019t have a partner to discuss with, but even when I did he was more useless than my pet rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never found it so difficult. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, and told menopause exasperates it. Or maybe this is something others in menopause face that are not ND. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any advice on how to tackle this? Maybe one of you have a coping strategy I can use.

I wanted to get them each a luxury perfume and have the bottle engraved but it would honestly be around $300-400 to do so and that\u2019s a big chunk and mine and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s honeymoon fund. what are some equally fancy and sentimental but affordable options they will love? no Rae Dunn esque suggestions please. lol i don\u2019t wanna get them cheap \u201cmother of ___\u201d robes bc i want something they will actually keep and cherish. also for my bridesmaids so far they have: matching pajamas, face mask, eye mask, lip oil and a matching shade of DIOR blush. i wanna top it off as well. it\u2019s a beach wedding but i don\u2019t want anything cheesy or crappy that gets tossed into the junkyard. again, i have a humble budget so pls don\u2019t suggest anything crazy. i have 12 bridesmaids as well so i also can\u2019t afford to drop $1500 for everyone\u2019s makeup or hair. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We narrowed the reception location down to three restaurants; 2 of the 3 won't allow music or dancing, and the third hasn't replied to my emails in 2 weeks. They're all serving bites of food for thousands of dollars. We have a really amazing rooftop overlooking the city, and I've been fantasizing of nixing the whole thing and choosing decorations, table settings, and food that are all actually intentional, even though coordinating everything alone might be a logistical nightmare itself. Clearly I'm all over the place, but I just really wanted to talk things out after wasting so many hours of my life trying to plan and having nothing to show for it.",

They&amp;#39;re all serving bites of food for thousands of dollars. We have a really amazing rooftop overlooking the city, and I&amp;#39;ve been fantasizing of nixing the whole thing and choosing decorations, table settings, and food that are all actually intentional, even though coordinating everything alone might be a logistical nightmare itself. Clearly I&amp;#39;m all over the place, but I just really wanted to talk things out after wasting so many hours of my life trying to plan and having nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Maybe we should have figured this out first, but we are first time homeowners figuring things out and surely making lots of mistakes as we go.\n\nWe took down the wall between the kitchen and dining room to open it up, both spaces were tiny. The flooring in the dining area is hardwood which carries through the rest of the main floor. The former kitchen has gross peeling linoleum. Unfortunately there is just plywood subfloor underneath. Originally wanted to extend the hardwood, but every flooring person I have talked to says it\u2019s impossible to match and we\u2019d have to do the entire main floor (which we don\u2019t want to do). \n\nIdeas on tile or other flooring? I\u2019ve considered cork, terrazzo, a fun pattern tile, nothing seems to feel right and at decision fatigue point.

        "selftext": "Rig decision fatigue, help...please?\n\nI am a single 37 yo female with small frenchie. I work a fully remote job in telehealth. \n\nI have dreamt of living in a small space forever-15 years!! First I thought I wanted a tinyhome... then it was a little pull behind trailer (airstream caravel), got quotes for 2 custom van conversions, hunted for used conversions, considered a truck topper camper..now I am considering maybe a class C?! Good lord. I HAVE done the research folks lol this may be a personal problem and just decision fatigue, perfectionism, and difficulty with risk-taking. I have downsized alot already and have been staying in very small spaces to prep. I would love to pull the trigger on something! To be frank, I feel like I am getting too old to float around and staying in my current state is going to really take a toll on me if I don't make a decision.\n\nMy family doesnt fully support this. Dad thinks I am foolish for spending money on something that will depreciate-Mom thinks deflecting her fear on me.\n\nIf anyone could please take the time to give me their take if they relate with my situation; I need some direction or insight from someone who has been through this- or knows what wont be a good option would even help steer me !\n\nWhat I am looking for/what to factor into decision: \n\nMy goal is to do this 1-2 years Full time with breaks as needed; traveling to find somewhere to live/invest. \n\nI have family and good friends (and a bed/home for breaks) in OR, MT, CA, AZ, and FL, and have thought about snagging friends and fam to bring with me on little weekend trips as part of my plans.  \n\nTherefore, I see myself mainly driving to/or nearby towns/small cities I want to explore-those of which have recreation (hiking, biking) nearby. \n\nThat being said, I will likely stay at rest stops, walmarts etc. To travel to destination towns. Once to destination, I'd stay at campground or state park to set up shop for the week, explore the community scene, restaurants, etc. Weekends I would explore the nearby recreation dabbling with boondocking over the 3 day weekend (while also dabbling with my internet capabilities to see if they can handle the demands of job-in case i like boondocking and want to transition to working there). Sunday travel to new town to do it again.\n\nCould go two ways here: boondock camp and drive into towns to explore vs RV camp drive to outskirts on weekends. Mind numbing to try and determine what will be my preference. Have no clue. \n\nI would be working Mon-Thur, 30-40 hours inside of the rig for about 70% of those hours on live zoom, as my work requires me to be in a private space. 30% I would like to sit outside as able.\n \nI will have an electric bike.\n\nI want a toilet, shower, an ergonomic work set up and ability to cook.\n\n\nThat being said, I will not scimp on security measures. Motion lights, alarms, cameras, weapon.\n\nBudget: I would like to stay below 100k, ideally, but could get a loan and go higher for right circumstance. If a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it means I'm happy and saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. For example, if I can get most of money back from a custom van conversion, I would consider it. \n\nI've seen used van conversions for 80-100k with most of my needs. I'm prepared to upgrade as needed. \n\nId need to buy a truck and pull behind trailer if I went that route.  \n\nI have done research on internet needs and it seems with increased tethering with 1-2 unlimited phone plans, mimo antenna, and starlink back up, I should find good internet somewhere! Not planning on depending on open internet options i.e. campgrounds.\n\nMy hang ups: \nTT: A small pull behind trailer may  have the room I may find I need for so much time spent in rig working at desk Mon-TR. Like idea of taking off in truck to explore town during week or weekends. May not do well off road-however I am not sure how rough of spots I will come across? Could get an off road one? Big con safety wise, can't jump in driver seat and take off... \n\nVan: super expensive new, hard to find used with exactly what you want/need, the airstream ones I have been in feel pretty narrow and cramped? Worried with work in there itll be confining. Honestly what put me onto vans was being able to leave a scary situation without going outside. \n\nClass C:  a small one (Mercedes /transit front end) couldddd work, but definitely no boondocking, so this is a no, right? \n\nTruck topper: Pro-cheaper. Any other positives Im not considering? Sounds uncomfortable to drive/manuever with my little experience...\n\nIf a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. \n\nI super appreciate anyones advice with this. I have completely uprooted my life in AK to make this transition. I have been living in families small guest spaces, and a set of storage bins for almost a year now, and just need a consistent space of my own.

I work a fully remote job in telehealth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have dreamt of living in a small space forever-15 years!! First I thought I wanted a tinyhome... then it was a little pull behind trailer (airstream caravel), got quotes for 2 custom van conversions, hunted for used conversions, considered a truck topper camper..now I am considering maybe a class C?! Good lord. I HAVE done the research folks lol this may be a personal problem and just decision fatigue, perfectionism, and difficulty with risk-taking. I have downsized alot already and have been staying in very small spaces to prep. I would love to pull the trigger on something! To be frank, I feel like I am getting too old to float around and staying in my current state is going to really take a toll on me if I don&amp;#39;t make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family doesnt fully support this. Dad thinks I am foolish for spending money on something that will depreciate-Mom thinks deflecting her fear on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone could please take the time to give me their take if they relate with my situation; I need some direction or insight from someone who has been through this- or knows what wont be a good option would even help steer me !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I am looking for/what to factor into decision: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My goal is to do this 1-2 years Full time with breaks as needed; traveling to find somewhere to live/invest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have family and good friends (and a bed/home for breaks) in OR, MT, CA, AZ, and FL, and have thought about snagging friends and fam to bring with me on little weekend trips as part of my plans.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I see myself mainly driving to/or nearby towns/small cities I want to explore-those of which have recreation (hiking, biking) nearby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I will likely stay at rest stops, walmarts etc. To travel to destination towns. Once to destination, I&amp;#39;d stay at campground or state park to set up shop for the week, explore the community scene, restaurants, etc. Weekends I would explore the nearby recreation dabbling with boondocking over the 3 day weekend (while also dabbling with my internet capabilities to see if they can handle the demands of job-in case i like boondocking and want to transition to working there). Sunday travel to new town to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could go two ways here: boondock camp and drive into towns to explore vs RV camp drive to outskirts on weekends. Mind numbing to try and determine what will be my preference. Have no clue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be working Mon-Thur, 30-40 hours inside of the rig for about 70% of those hours on live zoom, as my work requires me to be in a private space. 30% I would like to sit outside as able.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will have an electric bike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want a toilet, shower, an ergonomic work set up and ability to cook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I will not scimp on security measures. Motion lights, alarms, cameras, weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Budget: I would like to stay below 100k, ideally, but could get a loan and go higher for right circumstance. If a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it means I&amp;#39;m happy and saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. For example, if I can get most of money back from a custom van conversion, I would consider it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen used van conversions for 80-100k with most of my needs.

I wanted to preface this by saying I am primarily leaning towards exclusively pumping (and I do understand the nuance of what it CAN do to your sanity of having to clean parts constantly/bring a bunch of stuff with you when you aren't at home, etc.)  but I am not 100% set on a feeding method yet though; however, because my insurance covers a pump, I was like what the heck, why not. I have been lurking in the exclusively pumping subreddit, but I find that a lot of their recommendations are on pumps that aren't really easy to get in Canada and the more I search the more brands I end up discovering. I think currently I am stuck on a few options with portability/mobility being a HUGE factor along with accessibility to additional pump parts here in Canada (so I am not considering anything that requires me to sit plugged to a wall; although my husband asked me why I wouldn't wanna sit down in one spot when I wanna pump haha, I just like the idea of being able to move around IF needed. Not to mention just thinking about our couch, the outlet spots are a little awkward and inconvenient.)\n\nSpectra S1/S2 - heard primarily amazing things, only a small amount of people said suction was too strong/that the pump hurt, however, the off putting thing is that if purchased via Amazon to be shipped here, there is another thread where someone mentioned the warranty is not valid in Canada, which basically means if anything breaks or doesn't work down the road in the near future, I feel like I am just hooped. Or am I just making too big a deal out of this and that this pump don't typically fail so it's a minute risk that people often take in Canada?\n\nMedela Freestyle Flex - for some reason only BestBuy sells this one; all other stores will only sell the freestyle with the wearable cups although if I wanna spend some money on those pricey af wearable cups this is best of both worlds? However, I think I am letting the reviews perhaps get TOO into my head with newer Medela products in general but can't discount it when there are so many mentioning the same thing across all their different products that the pump motor or something with the pump failed within months, which is surprising to me because Medela has been a trusted brand for many years. The saving grace is that everyone DOES say the warranty is great, things get replaced very quickly, but I would imagine there is still some sort of lag time between the warranty claim vs. actually getting the parts to my door, so what would I do meanwhile? Use a manual pump? (I do have one single Medela Harmony and a few Haaka lady bug catchers primarily for let down.)\n\nWearables (Willow Go/Elvie - which the latter is attractive because I can get just one side for occasional pumping but not yet sold in Canada directly once again so likely have the same warranty issue? Plus the ONE side of the Elvie is almost the cost of some double pumps here) - these are NEVER recommended as primary due to less suction power therefore not emptying milk as well, but I am getting a little confused by the difference between Willow advertising themselves as hospital grade suction vs. the other pumps people recommend. Does hospital grade have a large range? Is it just a marketing gimmick these days? Or are they just not as good because they simply don't fit as well? Either way, I don't feel like I would drop that kind of price to use it as an occasional pump. Maybe I am being stubborn that maybe I can be in the minor percentage that can successfully use it as a primary just because they look nice and discreet but I feel like this is for the time being more bougie than useful.\n\nThanks for listening to my perhaps presumably useless ramblings going on in my head as I am weeks away from my due date :P",

Love the off the shoulder look with a sweetheart neckline, slit and floral details. We\u2019re getting married at a vineyard in the fall so that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nDress 1. Love the airy ethereal feel with glitter tulle, biscotti underlay and the floral/viney detailing. The slit ended up being a favorite feature. \n\nDress 2. Similar to dress 1 but more of a blush underlay. The detail on the train is beautiful.\n\nDress 3. The details really stood out in this one but wish it had a slit and a more modest neckline. \n\nThe last photo my matron of honor and I got to try dresses 2 &amp; 3 on since I had such a hard time choosing. Suggestions welcome if you have a dress in mind similar to these three! Appreciate your help \ud83d\udc95",

Love the off the shoulder look with a sweetheart neckline, slit and floral details. We\u2019re getting married at a vineyard in the fall so that\u2019s the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dress 1. Love the airy ethereal feel with glitter tulle, biscotti underlay and the floral/viney detailing. The slit ended up being a favorite feature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dress 2. Similar to dress 1 but more of a blush underlay. The detail on the train is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dress 3. The details really stood out in this one but wish it had a slit and a more modest neckline. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last photo my matron of honor and I got to try dresses 2 &amp;amp; 3 on since I had such a hard time choosing. Suggestions welcome if you have a dress in mind similar to these three! Appreciate your help \ud83d\udc95&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have really mastered the \"if it only takes 30 seconds to put it away just walk all the way to do that\" or \"if it takes 2 minutes to clean just do it\" sort of mindsets. Even if I'm struggling with functioning I still tend to tidy up my own spaces about once a week to once every other week.\n\nMy partner also has ADHD but struggles MAJORLY with executive dysfunction. They also have horrible object permanence so they are constantly surrounded by things because they either won't put them away because it's too much effort or they wont put them away because they will forget it exists if they do. On top of this they also have high decision fatigue.   \n\n\nBecause of all of this I have accepted that the house will never be clean all the time and there will always be SOME level of clutter. What is important to me is that the space feels *open*. I'm not as fussed about it being spotless.  \n\n\nWe made a goal this year that I want to have the house clean for every sabbat (pagan holidays. there are 8 spaced equally through the year). A few years ago we cleaned the house to celebrate Ostara and we both LOVED how it felt. My partner is completely on board with this goal.\n\nWhen I get overwhelmed by clutter that isn't mine things build up way worse than I'm willing to admit, and my partner rarely has the motivation to clean their stuff. So as a result we currently just clean the house to a baseline about twice a year.  \n\n\nSo this week is Imbolc so I have been working on getting the house cleaned.  Whenever the tidying involves my partners things I have them come over to help and I will hand them stuff which they will just collect in their hands. When I ask what they plan to do with it they just say \"I'm just going to put it somewhere else\" which has been driving me CRAZY. I want there to be designated spots for everything but inevitably it will all end up on top of the already existing pile of \"stuff to figure out what to do with\" that is sitting on top of our dog's crate or on top of my bookshelf or in the giant pile next to the laundry room or... you get the idea.  \n\n\nHow can I help them declutter while navigating the decision fatigue and also acknowledging that my partner ISN'T a minimalist? I don't care how much stuff they have I just want it put somewhere in an organized way and not in piles in various places around the house never to be looked at again. Like I said it's important to me that spaces feel open. I want light to be able to shine through areas. I want to feel like I can move in a space. But all these piles of miscellaneous objects are making me feel heavy.  \n\n\nAny advice?  \n\n\nTLDR my partner's way of helping me declutter is just to \"put it somewhere else\" which inevitably leads to random piles of miscellaneous objects around the house. How do I get them to decide on a place?",

I've only ever ridden road bikes (Specialized Dolce Elite, and Cannondale R500) but now I'm considering other options for longer rides, possibly bike camping? But also still commuting. Definitely will be on gravel and dirt pathways, too (not mountain bike territory) and feeling utterly overwhelmed by the options. Any advice on what would be my best options is greatly appreciated. I typically ride XS to small frames (I'm 5'2\") and very much open to marketplace and second hand finds.",

I&amp;#39;ve only ever ridden road bikes (Specialized Dolce Elite, and Cannondale R500) but now I&amp;#39;m considering other options for longer rides, possibly bike camping? But also still commuting. Definitely will be on gravel and dirt pathways, too (not mountain bike territory) and feeling utterly overwhelmed by the options. Any advice on what would be my best options is greatly appreciated. I typically ride XS to small frames (I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;2&amp;quot;) and very much open to marketplace and second hand finds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We don\u2019t live together, but he typically spends 4-5 nights per week at my apartment. He has a roommate and I do not. I also have 2 dogs and my apartment is ~10 mins closer to his work than his apartment, so it\u2019s just easier/more practical for him to sleep at my apartment instead of the other way around. \n\nI unfortunately allowed us to slip into a routine of me cooking dinner or paying for delivery for what feels like 80-90% of our meals. He basically only takes care of dinner on the nights we go out to a restaurant, which is about 1x per month, at most.\n\nAt first, I was okay with this because I was grateful he was willing to spend so much time at my place and I never had to commute to his place, so I felt like me taking on more of the cooking helped balance things out. But now that we\u2019ve established more of a pattern and have been dating long enough that he no longer feels like a normal \u201cguest\u201d in my apartment, I have been starting to feel resentful for three primary reasons. (1) My grocery bill has gone up exponentially now that I am buying for 2 people; (2) I\u2019m spending so much more time and energy on cooking. Before we started dating, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to eat cereal, ramen, or a hodge podge of snacks for dinner 1-3 times per week when I wasn\u2019t super hungry, but I feel like I can\u2019t do that now that I am also feeding a 6\u201d3\u2019, 195lb male that exercises several times per week. And (3) decision fatigue. Sounds silly, but I hate how much of a mental load shopping/cooking can be when your partner provides zero input and says \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d when asked what sounds good for dinner. If I give 3 options and ask him to pick, he will literally say \u201cany of those sound good, which I know doesn\u2019t help.\u201d So basically, the entire financial, physical, and mental load of meal time falls on me. \n\nBefore my boyfriend and I started dating, I would occasionally order meal kits from HelloFresh. The kits I ordered would send 3-4 meals consisting of two portions. I would normally eat one portion for dinner and bring the other portion for lunch the next day. But when my boyfriend started coming over more regularly, the second portion went to him. When we started dating, I started ordering  HelloFresh a bit more to help with the decision fatigue re: dinner choices and to make shopping a bit easier. There have been a few times where he will make himself a PB&amp;J after dinner bc the HelloFresh portions didn\u2019t fill him up. I have always noticed this, but frankly didn\u2019t care/think it was my responsibility to buy extra groceries to make the portion sizes bigger. \n\nOver the last couple weeks, I had actually been talking with my therapist about gentle ways to bring up my growing resentment/proposed solutions. But then last night, he made a few comments that forced an unexpected convo on the topic and has made me feel much worse about the situation. \n\nLast night, which was Valentine\u2019s Day (he didn\u2019t do anything for Valentine\u2019s Day, not even a card. Though I was expecting this, so I also didn\u2019t get him anything. I should\u2019ve communicated my expectations better, but I was disappointed he didn\u2019t put in ANY effort whatsoever to Valentine\u2019s Day. Anyways, I digress..) and I was cooking dinner. He said something to the effect of he hates how long it takes me to make dinner bc by the time we finish dinner and clean up, it\u2019s basically time for bed. He said he wants to try to work in more quick options for food. I was already a bit annoyed from a long day at work and the lack of initiative on V day, so I snapped back \u201cyou always just expect me to take care of dinner. If you want quicker options, then you can be more decisive and take the initiative to just get what you want and bring it over.\u201d I also told him he could help me cook or sit at the island and chat with me while I cook instead of plopping in front of the tv and watching sports until dinner is ready. To his credit, he responded well to this and said he would work on being more decisive and taking more initiative instead of constantly relying on me to make decisions and execute. \n\nThen somehow the conversation devolved and he eventually made a comment about how he doesn\u2019t always feel like there\u2019s enough food, esp on the nights I make HelloFresh. He told me him eating a PB&amp;J after dinner was his \u201csubtle\u201d way of letting me know I didn\u2019t make enough food. He referenced a non-HelloFresh meal I\u2019d made a few days prior (which I purposely made a giant portion so as to have leftovers for a few days) and said that amount of food was great. He also brought up the fact that I am a big snacker but snacks don\u2019t fill him up as much as they do for me and that he could eat 1000 pretzels and still be hungry.\n\nHe said he hadn\u2019t brought this up earlier bc he recognized I was doing a lot of work and he felt like \u201cwho am I to complain.\u201d I silently agreed \u201cyeah, who tf are you to complain!?\u201d in my head but didn\u2019t say much back.\n\n I was honestly a bit stunned and taken aback, so I just said \u201cwell I guess I won\u2019t order hellofresh anymore so I can control the portion sizes.\u201d Then I  reiterated that he is also free to take the responsibility for dinner whenever he wants and he can make the portion sizes as big as he wants.  I was angry in the moment and felt like it was extremely audacious of him to complain about having to make himself a PB&amp;J after I paid for and cooked the main meal. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve had time to reflect, I\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t bring up the fact that I had already been starting to feel resentful of the disproportionate division of labor/finances and that last night\u2019s complaints about my efforts just poured salt in my wounds. However, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong? Part of me feels extremely petty for keeping score like this, but I\u2019m also not interested in carrying on a relationship where this is the status quo. \n\nSome additional financial context, if it matters: I haven\u2019t explicitly asked him what his income is, but he is a private school teacher and I am an attorney. Context clues indicate I am earning somewhere between 2-3x more than him. However, I also suspect I have more monthly expenses than he does (larger student debt, 2 dogs, I don\u2019t have a roommate to split utilities with, etc), so our levels of disposable incomes may not be too different. \n\nUltimately, his comments about the portion sizing really rubbed me the wrong way and turned me off. It makes me feel defeated, unappreciated, and unmotivated to cook for him anymore. I think another conversation on this topic is in order, but I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it is reasonable of me to expect him to take on ~50% of the expenses (and energy) for dinner even though I earn more than him? How would you go about broaching this subject again?",

He said he wants to try to work in more quick options for food. I was already a bit annoyed from a long day at work and the lack of initiative on V day, so I snapped back \u201cyou always just expect me to take care of dinner. If you want quicker options, then you can be more decisive and take the initiative to just get what you want and bring it over.\u201d I also told him he could help me cook or sit at the island and chat with me while I cook instead of plopping in front of the tv and watching sports until dinner is ready. To his credit, he responded well to this and said he would work on being more decisive and taking more initiative instead of constantly relying on me to make decisions and execute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then somehow the conversation devolved and he eventually made a comment about how he doesn\u2019t always feel like there\u2019s enough food, esp on the nights I make HelloFresh. He told me him eating a PB&amp;amp;J after dinner was his \u201csubtle\u201d way of letting me know I didn\u2019t make enough food. He referenced a non-HelloFresh meal I\u2019d made a few days prior (which I purposely made a giant portion so as to have leftovers for a few days) and said that amount of food was great. He also brought up the fact that I am a big snacker but snacks don\u2019t fill him up as much as they do for me and that he could eat 1000 pretzels and still be hungry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said he hadn\u2019t brought this up earlier bc he recognized I was doing a lot of work and he felt like \u201cwho am I to complain.\u201d I silently agreed \u201cyeah, who tf are you to complain!?\u201d in my head but didn\u2019t say much back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was honestly a bit stunned and taken aback, so I just said \u201cwell I guess I won\u2019t order hellofresh anymore so I can control the portion sizes.\u201d Then I  reiterated that he is also free to take the responsibility for dinner whenever he wants and he can make the portion sizes as big as he wants.  I was angry in the moment and felt like it was extremely audacious of him to complain about having to make himself a PB&amp;amp;J after I paid for and cooked the main meal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I\u2019ve had time to reflect, I\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t bring up the fact that I had already been starting to feel resentful of the disproportionate division of labor/finances and that last night\u2019s complaints about my efforts just poured salt in my wounds. However, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong? Part of me feels extremely petty for keeping score like this, but I\u2019m also not interested in carrying on a relationship where this is the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some additional financial context, if it matters: I haven\u2019t explicitly asked him what his income is, but he is a private school teacher and I am an attorney. Context clues indicate I am earning somewhere between 2-3x more than him. However, I also suspect I have more monthly expenses than he does (larger student debt, 2 dogs, I don\u2019t have a roommate to split utilities with, etc), so our levels of disposable incomes may not be too different. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, his comments about the portion sizing really rubbed me the wrong way and turned me off. It makes me feel defeated, unappreciated, and unmotivated to cook for him anymore. I think another conversation on this topic is in order, but I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it is reasonable of me to expect him to take on ~50% of the expenses (and energy) for dinner even though I earn more than him? How would you go about broaching this subject again?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

People have given me quite a few suggestions but for some reason I can never make a decision. For years I always contemplated doing my degree again, but I never got around to it. Time and money seem to be the deciding factors in decision making. \n\nMy BA was in Sociology, and I considered being a therapist which requires me to get a BA. Now I don\u2019t particularly love sociology as a major to be honest, it seems like I just have to do it. It just feels like after nearly 8 years dropping out to find direction out of school, I never feel sure about anything? I think for me I need to feel sure about what I do 100% before I jump in and that prevents me from committing to larger life changes. Tried a bunch of different jobs but never landed anywhere I liked.\n\nI live in Toronto and want to be able to make at some point around 100k or around that and have a life that feels livable, but I don\u2019t want to make the wrong decision again because I know that time is not going backwards, only forwards. \n\nI don't have a strong math or sciences background either but I'm looking to do high school credits to maybe give me a shot at healthcare. I want to do something that\u2019s people oriented, has an analytical/problem solving portion and also makes the world a better place. \n\nAre there any other people here who can help me figure this out? I am looking to make a return for winter semester to boost my GPA and change programs or maybe go to college and transfer back into HR or social work. How do people know what to do? I am 29 and running out of time. Like a lot of people here, I grew up poor and am still poor so every decision is either helping me or hurting me now.",

I called Home Master to ask them if it's still usable (idk shit about anything) and they're like \"Nah bro, you need to toss that tank and the whole system, bacteria and shit probably growing in there now.\" \n\nAlright cool, I'm not buying another RO system from them.\n\nThis sent me down the rabbit hole of researching every possible brand and model there is and I have complete decision fatigue.\n\nI know there are many threads here recommending different systems for different requirements, but I'm at my wit's end. I can't decide on what I need and just need someone to tell me.\n\nI don't care about tankless vs tank or water flow rate. It's just me, my wife, and a dog. What I want is clean AF water + remineralization that I can actually trust is doing what it claims. I want as much flouride, PFOs, VOCs, chromium, cadmium, microplastics, et-FUCKING-cetera, removed from my water.\n\nIt's more important to me to have more / higher NSF certifications than the install (although fuck you Home Master and your complicated ass system) or the frequency and cost of filters. I will gladly pay a little bit more knowing that my water is legit and not poisoning me.\n\nThe Waterdrop G3P800 is nice, but it's hella expensive. I don't really want to pay that much, am more comfortable in the $500 range.\n\nI've watched so many youtube reviews, read so many articles, read my local water report like 15 times. \n\nPlease, r/WaterTreatment - you're my only hope. Tell me what to buy.\n\nEDIT: I thought about just putting something on my counter, but we don't have much counter space so under the sink is the move.",

I called Home Master to ask them if it&amp;#39;s still usable (idk shit about anything) and they&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;Nah bro, you need to toss that tank and the whole system, bacteria and shit probably growing in there now.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright cool, I&amp;#39;m not buying another RO system from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sent me down the rabbit hole of researching every possible brand and model there is and I have complete decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know there are many threads here recommending different systems for different requirements, but I&amp;#39;m at my wit&amp;#39;s end. I can&amp;#39;t decide on what I need and just need someone to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care about tankless vs tank or water flow rate. It&amp;#39;s just me, my wife, and a dog. What I want is clean AF water + remineralization that I can actually trust is doing what it claims. I want as much flouride, PFOs, VOCs, chromium, cadmium, microplastics, et-FUCKING-cetera, removed from my water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more important to me to have more / higher NSF certifications than the install (although fuck you Home Master and your complicated ass system) or the frequency and cost of filters. I will gladly pay a little bit more knowing that my water is legit and not poisoning me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Waterdrop G3P800 is nice, but it&amp;#39;s hella expensive. I don&amp;#39;t really want to pay that much, am more comfortable in the $500 range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve watched so many youtube reviews, read so many articles, read my local water report like 15 times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please, &lt;a href=\"/r/WaterTreatment\"&gt;r/WaterTreatment&lt;/a&gt; - you&amp;#39;re my only hope. Tell me what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I thought about just putting something on my counter, but we don&amp;#39;t have much counter space so under the sink is the move.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

First I thought I wanted a tinyhome... then it was a little pull behind trailer (airstream caravel), got quotes for 2 custom van conversions, hunted for used conversions, considered a truck topper camper..now I am considering maybe a class C?! Good lord. I HAVE done the research folks lol this may be a personal problem and just decision fatigue, perfectionism, and difficulty with risk-taking. I have downsized alot already and have been staying in very small spaces to prep. I would love to pull the trigger on something! To be frank, I feel like I am getting too old to float around and staying in my current state is going to really take a toll on me if I don't make a decision.\n\nMy family doesnt fully support this. Dad thinks I am foolish for spending money on something that will depreciate-Mom thinks deflecting her fear on me.\n\nIf anyone could please take the time to give me their take if they relate with my situation; I need some direction or insight from someone who has been through this- or knows what wont be a good option would even help steer me !\n\nWhat I am looking for/what to factor into decision: \n\nMy goal is to do this 1-2 years Full time with breaks as needed; traveling to find somewhere to live/invest. \n\nI have family and good friends (and a bed/home for breaks) in OR, MT, CA, AZ, and FL, and have thought about snagging friends and fam to bring with me on little weekend trips as part of my plans.  \n\nTherefore, I see myself mainly driving to/or nearby towns/small cities I want to explore-those of which have recreation (hiking, biking) nearby. \n\nThat being said, I will likely stay at rest stops, walmarts etc. To travel to destination towns. Once to destination, I'd stay at campground or state park to set up shop for the week, explore the community scene, restaurants, etc. Weekends I would explore the nearby recreation dabbling with boondocking over the 3 day weekend (while also dabbling with my internet capabilities to see if they can handle the demands of job-in case i like boondocking and want to transition to working there). Sunday travel to new town to do it again.\n\nCould go two ways here: boondock camp and drive into towns to explore vs RV camp drive to outskirts on weekends. Mind numbing to try and determine what will be my preference. Have no clue. \n\nI would be working Mon-Thur, 30-40 hours inside of the rig for about 70% of those hours on live zoom, as my work requires me to be in a private space. 30% I would like to sit outside as able.\n \nI will have an electric bike.\n\nI want a toilet, shower, an ergonomic work set up and ability to cook.\n\nI will say there is something eerie to me about being in the middle of the woods and not reallyyyy knowing if no one is there. Both if sitting outside, cooking with door open, recreating from BLM. And if I ever got a knock boondocking. I . Would. Die. At a campground I would not be scared of this situation.   Am I tripping about something that I shouldn't ?\n\nThat being said, I will not scimp on security measures. Motion lights, alarms, cameras, weapon.\n\nMy hang ups: \nTT: A small pull behind trailer may  have the room I may find I need for so much time spent in rig working at desk Mon-TR. Like idea of taking off in truck to explore town during week or weekends. May not do well off road-however I am not sure how rough of spots I will come across? Could get an off road one? Big con safety wise, can't jump in driver seat and take off... \n\nVan: super expensive new, hard to find used with exactly what you want/need, the airstream ones I have been in feel pretty narrow and cramped? Worried with work in there itll be confining. Honestly what put me onto vans was being able to leave a scary situation without going outside. \n\nClass C:  a small one (Mercedes /transit front end) couldddd work, but definitely no boondocking, so this is a no, right? \n\nTruck topper: Pro-cheaper. Any other positives Im not considering? Sounds uncomfortable to drive/manuever with my little experience...\n\nIf a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. \n\nI super appreciate anyones advice with this. I have completely uprooted my life in AK to make this transition. I have been living in families small guest spaces, and a set of storage bins for almost a year now, and just need a consistent space of my own. I have been stuck between making a wise sound decision while also trying to move forward with my dream/life. :)\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all who are helping provide some advice! :)\n\nBudget: I would like to stay below 100k, ideally, but could get a loan and go higher for right circumstance. If a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it means I'm happy and saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. For example, if I can get most of money back from a custom van conversion, I would consider it. \n\nI've seen used van conversions for 80-100k with most of my needs. I'm prepared to upgrade as needed. \n\nId need to buy a truck and pull behind trailer if I went that route.  \n\nI have done research on internet needs and it seems with increased tethering with 1-2 unlimited phone plans, mimo antenna, and starlink back up, I should find good internet somewhere! Not planning on depending on open internet options i.e. campgrounds.",

And in some cases, something or things are always on my mind, and never acted on. Those are the things that really have me worried. \n\nI listen to podcasts like Rich Roll and Feel Better Live More, where they talk about doing things that I know I should be doing, and after many episodes I\u2019ve said to myself or my partner, \u201cOkay, we really gotta do X!\u201d \n\nBut there never seems to be any time for it. We both work, and commute to work, and we have a 12 year old. Between working, commuting, making meals, and helping our kid with homework, there\u2019s hardly time left in the day to tidy up, much less deep clean anything, schedule doctor appointments, exercise, etc. We have cars and a home to maintain (which I do, or I schedule the appointments for).\n\nI\u2019m 35, and I\u2019ve been paying for health insurance for the past 17 years. I\u2019ve used it once. I\u2019ve exercised in earnest a few times in my life. I\u2019ve never gone to therapy. I haven\u2019t kept a healthy habit but I\u2019ve started plenty. \n\nHere is a list of specific things that I wish I could find/make time / get motivated for, but can\u2019t seem to, and the reasons I haven\u2019t:\n\n- Finding a primary care doctor\n\nI despise the American health system, and feel like I can\u2019t trust any doctors to not just prescribe me something or tell me I\u2019m fit when I know I\u2019m not. I want a doctor that\u2019s going to encourage me to be more active and help me set goals and action plans. I want a doctor that\u2019s going to be proactive, not reactive. My wife had to *tell* her doctors what she thought was wrong with her a couple years ago before they even considered it. And even then they didn\u2019t run diagnostics until a few visits later. \n\n- Finding a therapist\n\nI tried BetterHelp during the pandemic, went through three therapists before even meeting them, and gave up. I reached out to a therapist group recently, and they called me back a couple weeks ago, but I haven\u2019t returned the call. \n\n- Getting active\n\nWhere do I even start? Strength is important, so is VO2 max, and then there\u2019s this whole food thing, and how you should be fueling your body appropriately\u2026 Running is bad on the body, but better than nothing. I can\u2019t even begin to learn all that! And again, time! Energy is also a big one. I leave for work at 5:15, and get home around 4:30 PM. I\u2019m tired and unmotivated. \n\n- Making meals\n\nMy wife has been doing 99% of all meal making and grocery shopping for a decade. I want to help more, especially since I get home before she does. I\u2019m not a great cook - I don\u2019t know a lot about fats and starches and stuff, or how to make a balanced meal, or how to make something from what\u2019s in the fridge. \n\nI\u2019ve asked her to leave recipes for me, but she hasn\u2019t. She\u2019s left names of dishes, but those are somewhere in a recipe book, or in her brain. I think at this point she feels that it\u2019s less work to just do it herself than to create a system that I can work with. And I feel bad if I press her on it because her time is so limited. \n\nHow do functioning adults do all of this?",

Or, I'll say something in class and end up forgetting what to say when another student interrupts me or accidentally say the wrong thing in response. \n\nI'm only 30 but even after work and on the weekends, I'm often racked with indecisiveness and low productivity in regard to running errands, booking appointments etc. I'm feeling really stupid these days and was wondering if anyone felt the same as a teacher or if it's just me.",

        "selftext": "My husband (29M) and I (36F) have been trying for about a year and a half, with no luck, and seemingly no progress. As each month passes, my resolve to keep trying wanes, and it's harder and harder to make the choice to keep at it. \n\nI'm frustrated that so much of the effort and risk has fallen on me, as the person with a uterus. \n\nAbout a year ago, I tapered off of my ADHD medication, because I couldn't find any clear guidance on whether a stimulant will prevent implantation or cause early miscarriage. Of course there's \"no way to ethically research\" this topic, and my doctors have treated the question like a hot potato (GP said to ask my psychiatrist who said to ask my OB who said to consult with my psychiatrist). \n\nI've been dutifully taking my prenatal, as well as some other supplements (calcium, iron) recommended by my ND. I've cut wayyy back on my vices, and took six months fully off of alcohol to see if that made any difference. I've started watching my macros and making sure I consume around 100g of protein most days. I went to weekly acupuncture for a couple of months, to a person who specializes in hormone health and reproductive care. \n\nI've been tracking my BBT for about a year, first with a morning temp check, and then with the TempDrop arm band, which was pricey but helped with having confidence in what my BBT is. I have been testing with OPKs every other month or so. All of the equipment, supplements, healthcare, tests, I have purchased and managed.\n\nI've gotten half a dozen blood draws and a pelvic ultrasound, all of which came back as within the normal range, nothing looked concerning. Despite my husband being much more definitively interested in having a child, I had to practically beg him to get a sperm test. So far the *only* negative feedback we've received from these tests is that his sperm looked like he was dehydrated. And somehow, while my physicians have encouraged me to live with a kind of monk-like purity, his doctors keep telling him he doesn't need to make any lifestyle changes, and that his substantial cannabis consumption is unlikely to have any impact on his fertility. \n\nIn a private conversation with my husband, my MIL offered to pay for IVF. I've been very definitive that I am not willing to do IVF. I feel violated that this conversation happened behind my back, and resent that my husband, in laws, and one of my parents are all eagerly watching my body and waiting for a baby to pop out of it.\n\nIn the past year, our sex life has transformed from a fun, spontaneous, and mutually pleasurable dynamic, to a mission-oriented series of rote tasks. If I have an orgasm, it is a quiet, solitary thing that I do on my own time, separate from the business of getting sperm into me. \n\nMy husband is frustrated that I only talk about the negative aspects of this process. He wants to hear more hope and excitement from me. But I don't feel hope and excitement. Since I've borne the vast majority of the costs and efforts to conceive over the last year, and since my pleasure and bodily autonomy have been the first things to be sacrificed to build a family... I expect that pregnancy and parenthood will be a similarly imbalanced division of \"labor\" vs. \"fruits of labor,\" of risk vs. reward... I've been using up ALL of my positive energy in taking action toward conceiving, and at the end of the day, I feel exhausted and sad about how the process has gone, not excited about what *might* come of it.\n\nAnd, of course, with our age difference, I'm acutely aware that the longer this takes, the more precarious the stakes are for my health. \n\nEach month, as the end of my cycle approaches, I run through this laundry list of sunk costs, and find myself feeling less and less inclined to keep making this effort. I don't know how to rebalance the effort to conceive in our marriage, how to reintroduce my pleasure into our sex life, or how to find the determination to keep at it. \n\nFor as long as we've been TFAB, I still manage to hop back on the fence every month, when it doesn't happen. \n\nTL;DR - 16 cycles of TTC and the inequity of effort and changes to how I relate to my body and sex have me drained!",

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband (29M) and I (36F) have been trying for about a year and a half, with no luck, and seemingly no progress. As each month passes, my resolve to keep trying wanes, and it&amp;#39;s harder and harder to make the choice to keep at it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m frustrated that so much of the effort and risk has fallen on me, as the person with a uterus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I tapered off of my ADHD medication, because I couldn&amp;#39;t find any clear guidance on whether a stimulant will prevent implantation or cause early miscarriage. Of course there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;no way to ethically research&amp;quot; this topic, and my doctors have treated the question like a hot potato (GP said to ask my psychiatrist who said to ask my OB who said to consult with my psychiatrist). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dutifully taking my prenatal, as well as some other supplements (calcium, iron) recommended by my ND. I&amp;#39;ve cut wayyy back on my vices, and took six months fully off of alcohol to see if that made any difference. I&amp;#39;ve started watching my macros and making sure I consume around 100g of protein most days. I went to weekly acupuncture for a couple of months, to a person who specializes in hormone health and reproductive care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been tracking my BBT for about a year, first with a morning temp check, and then with the TempDrop arm band, which was pricey but helped with having confidence in what my BBT is. I have been testing with OPKs every other month or so. All of the equipment, supplements, healthcare, tests, I have purchased and managed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gotten half a dozen blood draws and a pelvic ultrasound, all of which came back as within the normal range, nothing looked concerning. Despite my husband being much more definitively interested in having a child, I had to practically beg him to get a sperm test. So far the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; negative feedback we&amp;#39;ve received from these tests is that his sperm looked like he was dehydrated. And somehow, while my physicians have encouraged me to live with a kind of monk-like purity, his doctors keep telling him he doesn&amp;#39;t need to make any lifestyle changes, and that his substantial cannabis consumption is unlikely to have any impact on his fertility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a private conversation with my husband, my MIL offered to pay for IVF. I&amp;#39;ve been very definitive that I am not willing to do IVF. I feel violated that this conversation happened behind my back, and resent that my husband, in laws, and one of my parents are all eagerly watching my body and waiting for a baby to pop out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past year, our sex life has transformed from a fun, spontaneous, and mutually pleasurable dynamic, to a mission-oriented series of rote tasks. If I have an orgasm, it is a quiet, solitary thing that I do on my own time, separate from the business of getting sperm into me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is frustrated that I only talk about the negative aspects of this process. He wants to hear more hope and excitement from me. But I don&amp;#39;t feel hope and excitement. Since I&amp;#39;ve borne the vast majority of the costs and efforts to conceive over the last year, and since my pleasure and bodily autonomy have been the first things to be sacrificed to build a family... I expect that pregnancy and parenthood will be a similarly imbalanced division of &amp;quot;labor&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;fruits of labor,&amp;quot; of risk vs. reward... I&amp;#39;ve been using up ALL of my positive energy in taking action toward conceiving, and at the end of the day, I feel exhausted and sad about how the process has gone, not excited about what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, of course, with our age difference, I&amp;#39;m acutely aware that the longer this takes, the more precarious the stakes are for my health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each month, as the end of my cycle approaches, I run through this laundry list of sunk costs, and find myself feeling less and less inclined to keep making this effort. I don&amp;#39;t know how to rebalance the effort to conceive in our marriage, how to reintroduce my pleasure into our sex life, or how to find the determination to keep at it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For as long as we&amp;#39;ve been TFAB, I still manage to hop back on the fence every month, when it doesn&amp;#39;t happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - 16 cycles of TTC and the inequity of effort and changes to how I relate to my body and sex have me drained!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        "selftext": "I don't want this to sound like a [r/reationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/reationship/) post, but I want to give you all a little background. A little understanding as to why this is so important to me and why I **can't not** DM a game, despite all my shortcomings.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 16 years, since we were both about 15. She is the single most important thing in my life. Because of Covid, our usual DnD game has been suspended for the foreseeable future. We haven't had a game since February and it is breaking my wife's heart. She works so hard every day in an incredibly stressful job and spends her nights listening to DnD liveplay podcasts. She talks about how badly she wishes she could play again.\n\nRecently, she asked me if I would be willing to DM a game with a small number of our closest friends (who will play remotely). I was sure she was joking. She kept asking and I realized she was serious. I realized that in 16 years, this is the second biggest thing she as ever asked me to do. The first being when she asked ME to marry her. My wife, sweet, smart, and endlessly compassionate, doesn't ask me for anything, ***ever.*** This must be important to her.\n\nI agreed. I agreed because I lost my job due to the pandemic and I can, will, and want to do this for her. She deserves to be happy and I want to take as much of the burden of the real world off of her shoulders as I can. Especially because I am not contributing as much as I was when I had a job.\n\nThe problem is: I am not a smart person. I am not quick or very clever. That joke, \"DnD is all math and improv!\" -- I put two math teachers into retirement (not kidding). I made my high school drama teacher cry laughing -- in a very bad way. But my wife, being the amazing person she is, thinks I can do anything. I know better and I am not confident I can run an interesting/fun game. If it matters, I am also dyslexic and it can be embarrassing to talk at length. It fusses with my language center of my head and that doesn't mesh well with a fantasy setting with fantasy names.\n\nI am reading the core books cover-to-cover and am actively researching how to DM. I am devoting a few hours a day to studying online resources. I have audiobooks to listen to while I am doing my chores. I want to do well. I have a little experience with DnD especially and two years with a paper RPG. That, I am discovering, is woefully little enough to take on the task of being a DM.\n\nI feel good about storytelling and NPC creation. I am trying to bring in interesting elements of science and philosophy I know my players would find interesting. I like creative writing and actively enjoy worldbuilding.\n\nI feel terrified of keeping rules in my head, the math involved, and managing a game with three players who will derail any plans I make. I am not quick on my feet.\n\n**I apologize. This got long.**\n\n**tl;dr**: dumbass needs help DMing to prove love and commitment to an amazing woman.\n\nAny thoughts? Ideas? Maybe a little reassurances or hard truths?\n\nThank you so much for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI am going to be honest. I posted this just before bed and rolled over five minutes later, feeling self-conscious about spilling my guts out, and *thought* I deleted this post. When I woke up this morning, my wife rushed into the bedroom to tell me she found this and that I had over 200 replies. I poured a huge cup of coffee, sat down, and read them **all.**\n\nNot going to lie, I am overwhelmed in the best way. The outpouring of support is more than I could have ever expected. I am blown away by the number of people offering to talk with me personally. That is amazing and so very, very thoughtful. From the bottom of my heart: Thank you, every single one of you who took the time to read this and reply. I want to reply to each and every one of you. With so many replies, I won't be able to. Know that I have read them all!\n\n**In response to the advice you all have been so kind to offer:**\n\nI did run a series of two-hour-long-ish games with just my wife with a very simple goal. I had her solve a murder mystery, role-play heavy. I hardly prepared at all, with just NPC names and a *very* general idea, as a test to see if I could think on my feet with each of her decisions. It went very well! At least she says so. As many of you have said, I did fuck up and make mistakes. It was so much easier with just her. I learned a lot in such a short time and it confirmed what many of you have said: She either didn't notice the fuck-ups or didn't care. She got to be a hero and that's all that mattered to her.\n\nIn response to relying on other players with rules, etc. One of my players *is a DM* of her own game. I didn't realize how focused I was on how she might think of me negatively that it didn't occur to me that I might instead lean on her expertise. In speaking with her, I found out she doesn't to any prep work at all, save downing several glasses of wine. The fact that I have basic lore for this world is blowing her mind. That might be what spurred me on to prep *more* to impress her. Thanks to all of you, I will let that go. It will be a fun game either way.\n\nYou all are very right. One player is my wife, the other is her best friend, and the other is our closest friend. They know me and will understand if I flub a word or take time to think. They have all seen me toasted on whiskey at 3am and going off on facts about shipwrecks; I doubt they will concentrate on a mispronounced word or two. Mistakes are going to happen and I can't let the fact that I am *a bit* (haha, a huge one) of a perfectionist get in the way.\n\nIn a similar vein, these are my closest friends. I know what media they have consumed and what they like to see in a story. I am lucky to know that one player wants to be an All Might-like hero, another wants to have a complex character with challenged morals, and another wants to get sauced and socialize. In regards to stealing ideas: I am totally doing that. With players who love both high fantasy and sci-fi epics, I want to be able to give them the best of both worlds. All three of them love stories with deep lore and twists, which I believe I can bring to the table.\n\nI have asked my players what they would like from this game. Hilariously, I received three different replies. My wife wants to roleplay and laugh, another wants a hack and slash, and the third hardly cares. I will try my best to mix it up!\n\nOne thing that did surprise me is how many replies told me not to over-prep my games. I didn't realize how that might become a real problem. In one way, I am trying to do that. I am setting it up for a number of options for the players, while also realizing that they might not take any of them. I am trying my very, very best not to railroad them into my preconstructed ideas. Three very creative players at my table is daunting; they will take me by surprise. I am prepared to laugh and make it silly. I really do hope they give me stories to tell about how they circumvented my plans with truly amazing feats of roundabout thinking. I was mainly worried about 'decision fatigue' and bringing down the mood of the game.\n\nAnother surprise was how many of you told me not to focus on the books! Thanks to the fact that I have listened to the DnD liveplays with my wife over and over again, I do have an understanding on how the game functions. You were all right: I was putting DMs on a pedestal. Trying my best and allowing lots of flexibility will get me to the goal -- a fun and engaging game.\n\nMany replies said to start small. I hear you 100%!! That is technically the game plan as it stands now. I have a whole 'arc zero' of about two to five games with the expressed purpose of getting to know my players. There is a really simple goal planned: find cave, find the missing heiress, find the mystery of the main story. The next arc is similar; help the refugees find medicine and hunt down a thief. After that, I am hoping it can build into plenty of chances to battle and roleplay.\n\n***Yes, my wife found this post***. *Immediately.* She assured me that I am not an idiot and I will always listen to her when she talks with me with that open heart of hers. She also cried from fuzzy feelings. I told her all about how dedicated I am a while back, but seeing it in words made her realize how committed I am. I won't treat this game like a chore, but I will take the goal of making her happy as my greatest motivation.\n\n**Extra edit:** \n\nMy wonderful bride bought me lunch today as a thank you and told me flat-out not to put too much pressure on myself. I will redirect my brain away from all my worries and just allow myself to do the best I can and have as much fun as possible! ",

A little understanding as to why this is so important to me and why I &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;#39;t not&lt;/strong&gt; DM a game, despite all my shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been together for 16 years, since we were both about 15. She is the single most important thing in my life. Because of Covid, our usual DnD game has been suspended for the foreseeable future. We haven&amp;#39;t had a game since February and it is breaking my wife&amp;#39;s heart. She works so hard every day in an incredibly stressful job and spends her nights listening to DnD liveplay podcasts. She talks about how badly she wishes she could play again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, she asked me if I would be willing to DM a game with a small number of our closest friends (who will play remotely). I was sure she was joking. She kept asking and I realized she was serious. I realized that in 16 years, this is the second biggest thing she as ever asked me to do. The first being when she asked ME to marry her. My wife, sweet, smart, and endlessly compassionate, doesn&amp;#39;t ask me for anything, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This must be important to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agreed. I agreed because I lost my job due to the pandemic and I can, will, and want to do this for her. She deserves to be happy and I want to take as much of the burden of the real world off of her shoulders as I can. Especially because I am not contributing as much as I was when I had a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is: I am not a smart person. I am not quick or very clever. That joke, &amp;quot;DnD is all math and improv!&amp;quot; -- I put two math teachers into retirement (not kidding). I made my high school drama teacher cry laughing -- in a very bad way. But my wife, being the amazing person she is, thinks I can do anything. I know better and I am not confident I can run an interesting/fun game. If it matters, I am also dyslexic and it can be embarrassing to talk at length. It fusses with my language center of my head and that doesn&amp;#39;t mesh well with a fantasy setting with fantasy names.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am reading the core books cover-to-cover and am actively researching how to DM. I am devoting a few hours a day to studying online resources. I have audiobooks to listen to while I am doing my chores. I want to do well. I have a little experience with DnD especially and two years with a paper RPG. That, I am discovering, is woefully little enough to take on the task of being a DM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel good about storytelling and NPC creation. I am trying to bring in interesting elements of science and philosophy I know my players would find interesting. I like creative writing and actively enjoy worldbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel terrified of keeping rules in my head, the math involved, and managing a game with three players who will derail any plans I make. I am not quick on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I apologize. This got long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: dumbass needs help DMing to prove love and commitment to an amazing woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? Ideas? Maybe a little reassurances or hard truths?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am going to be honest. I posted this just before bed and rolled over five minutes later, feeling self-conscious about spilling my guts out, and &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; I deleted this post. When I woke up this morning, my wife rushed into the bedroom to tell me she found this and that I had over 200 replies. I poured a huge cup of coffee, sat down, and read them &lt;strong&gt;all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not going to lie, I am overwhelmed in the best way. The outpouring of support is more than I could have ever expected. I am blown away by the number of people offering to talk with me personally. That is amazing and so very, very thoughtful. From the bottom of my heart: Thank you, every single one of you who took the time to read this and reply. I want to reply to each and every one of you. With so many replies, I won&amp;#39;t be able to. Know that I have read them all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In response to the advice you all have been so kind to offer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did run a series of two-hour-long-ish games with just my wife with a very simple goal. I had her solve a murder mystery, role-play heavy. I hardly prepared at all, with just NPC names and a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; general idea, as a test to see if I could think on my feet with each of her decisions. It went very well! At least she says so. As many of you have said, I did fuck up and make mistakes. It was so much easier with just her.
