I was able to jump in to cleaning without feeling overwhelmed, and I didn't get decision fatigue from picking what chores to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I love this podcast:\n\n* The podcast is pretty much body doubling on demand for cleaning. ADHD brains find it easier to get stuff done if someone else is being productive with them, and this podcast takes advantage of that.\n* The host seems to really get it. She gives specific advice for lots of different situations with zero judgement.\n* She tells you what room to start in, and what to do first in that room. She tells you when to change rooms, and manages the timing for you so you don't have to watch a clock.\n* While you clean she talks in the background about her life, and gives reminders about when it's time to switch tasks.\n* She has a huge variety of podcasts. Some hour long whole house cleaning sessions, some 20 minute quick cleans, and some podcasts are an hour of deep cleaning one room or decluttering.\n* She does a whole house cleaning approach, where you spend a little time in each room. It stopped me from hyperfocusing in one area and neglecting everything else.",

I say this because I think some of these things contribute to not only physical clutter, but maybe also mental clutter for me, in that they force me to often think through so many choices.\n\nEx:\n\n1. I have a lot of clothes. This forces me to make decisions that take up mental bandwidth, and then invariably leads to a big huge pile of laundry because I wait till I've worn nearly everything to do it.\n\n2. I'll buy enough groceries for two weeks, but because they are in my fridge I frequently forget about them, and half go bad, and then I procrastinate and end up with a big fridge-clean out job.\n\n3. I have three streaming services...and I pretty much scroll endlessly, watching very little.\n\nI have a storage locker in my apartment building that already needs a bit of a clean out, but I'm wondering if I sort of use it to \"test\" a bit of radical decluttering of clothes and stuff? What if I also clean off my phone and unsubscribe from a few of my services - it's not like any of that isn't irreversible, and I'm wondering if that might sort of force me to focus / leave me with more energy to focus on a few key things I really need to work on? I say this because I think the \"stuff\" also contributes to some of my memory problems (ie: my meditation app is on my home screen, but so are dozens of other apps, and I frequently don't even notice it anymore).\n\nThoughts?

It has been years since I've read a book on my own for the sake of reading, and I, like many of us, used to be a very avid reader. Since my diagnosis November of 2020, I have been fixated on ADHD and learning all I can and trying to figure out how to work with my brain to get things done. I thought I could maybe use this fixation to my advantage and pick an adhd based book to dive into and achieve my goal. Well... that plan isn't going so smoothly. \n\nI have looked through posts here on this sub for book recommendations as well as just scrolling through the Kindle shop (I want ebooks so they're easily accesible). I've gotten a list of books to look into but it seems like every time I find a book that might be interesting, I go to the reviews and find a couple negative ones that leave a sour taste in my mouth and I no longer see the book as being worth the cost, time, or mental energy to read it. \n\nThis dilemma has been a huge hurdle for me when trying to get back into reading over the years - either I find one or two bad reviews that ruin my excitement over it, or I find one thing I dislike about the book and it causes me to stop reading it entirely. I am so picky and selective when it comes to choosing books because I tend to have pretty low energy (adhd plus a myriad of other mental and physical health issues) and I worry so much about \"wasting\" that energy on a book that turns out to be bad. \n\nI guess my point in making this post is - does anyone else experience this over-selectivity when trying to find books or other media? And do you have any tips for coping with or overcoming it? Also if anyone could recommend any books about adhd that lean more towards a science based explanation of it or even more geared towards a therapists perspective (as I am studying to be a therapist with a focus on adhd patients) it would be greatly appreciated!",

We went on vacation recently with family and when my AuDHD nephew needed time away it was enforced we need to respect this. When I needed time away it was \u201cinconsiderate and antisocial\u201d.

When I go shopping, my mind is flooded with thoughts about prices, whether I\u2019m buying too much or too little, and if I\u2019m making the right choices. I\u2019m also finding it hard to manage other responsibilities, like school activities, meal planning, and daily chores.\n\nI\u2019m currently on Concerta for what might be ADHD, but it hasn\u2019t been helpful. Instead of improving my focus, it suppresses my thoughts and makes me feel more lazy and prone to procrastination. I\u2019ve also had headaches and a lack of motivation.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this kind of decision fatigue and found effective strategies to manage it? What resources or tools have helped you handle daily tasks and reduce stress? I\u2019m open to any advice or recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

When I go shopping, my mind is flooded with thoughts about prices, whether I\u2019m buying too much or too little, and if I\u2019m making the right choices. I\u2019m also finding it hard to manage other responsibilities, like school activities, meal planning, and daily chores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m currently on Concerta for what might be ADHD, but it hasn\u2019t been helpful. Instead of improving my focus, it suppresses my thoughts and makes me feel more lazy and prone to procrastination. I\u2019ve also had headaches and a lack of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else dealt with this kind of decision fatigue and found effective strategies to manage it? What resources or tools have helped you handle daily tasks and reduce stress? I\u2019m open to any advice or recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for your help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I made some major life changes that I thought would help with burnout, and it helped some, but I've fallen back into old patterns of trying to do too much and then feeling lots of shame and frustration when I can't do more. This week, my therapist shared that she thinks I have ADHD burnout. She thinks I need time to rest and heal before my brain and body will be able to function better like it used to. She also talked about how, for people with ADHD, \"rest\" might look different, like we still need some easy things to do that can keep us occupied, but without trying to do productive things on our to-do lists. This resonated, as I can't just sit and watch TV to relax, I've gotta be knitting or on my phone or writing cards to my family or paying bills etc while I'm watching TV. I like reading, but after a while, I start to get bored and skip ahead to future chapters to see what's going to happen. I've been enjoying more graphic novels lately, and maybe the visual component helps sustain my attention better than words on a page, but they're so short, and I get decision fatigue about what to read next.\n\nI'm going to be thinking more about what rest and burnout recovery looks like for me and how to implement that practically. Taking 12 weeks off of work isn't practical, but maybe actually taking my weekends to rest and do fun things instead of work/chores? I'm self-employed, so there's literally always some work to do, and I'll often spend several hours on the weekend working, trying to catch up on things. But she thinks I need to rest and heal before trying to catch up vs. \"I need to catch up, and then I'll relax\" (which, as we know, never happens; we never actually get through that to-do list!) \n\n# I'm curious about others' experiences with ADHD burnout, and have any of you been able to recover from it? What did burnout recovery look like for you? What helped? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n# Also, as a woman with ADHD, what kinds of activities feel restful to you? What do you do exactly when you're at home and want to do something that's fun and relaxing? ",

This week, my therapist shared that she thinks I have ADHD burnout. She thinks I need time to rest and heal before my brain and body will be able to function better like it used to. She also talked about how, for people with ADHD, &amp;quot;rest&amp;quot; might look different, like we still need some easy things to do that can keep us occupied, but without trying to do productive things on our to-do lists. This resonated, as I can&amp;#39;t just sit and watch TV to relax, I&amp;#39;ve gotta be knitting or on my phone or writing cards to my family or paying bills etc while I&amp;#39;m watching TV. I like reading, but after a while, I start to get bored and skip ahead to future chapters to see what&amp;#39;s going to happen. I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying more graphic novels lately, and maybe the visual component helps sustain my attention better than words on a page, but they&amp;#39;re so short, and I get decision fatigue about what to read next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be thinking more about what rest and burnout recovery looks like for me and how to implement that practically. Taking 12 weeks off of work isn&amp;#39;t practical, but maybe actually taking my weekends to rest and do fun things instead of work/chores? I&amp;#39;m self-employed, so there&amp;#39;s literally always some work to do, and I&amp;#39;ll often spend several hours on the weekend working, trying to catch up on things. But she thinks I need to rest and heal before trying to catch up vs. &amp;quot;I need to catch up, and then I&amp;#39;ll relax&amp;quot; (which, as we know, never happens; we never actually get through that to-do list!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious about others&amp;#39; experiences with ADHD burnout, and have any of you been able to recover from it? What did burnout recovery look like for you? What helped? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Also, as a woman with ADHD, what kinds of activities feel restful to you? What do you do exactly when you&amp;#39;re at home and want to do something that&amp;#39;s fun and relaxing?&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But when someone has trouble planning, we make \u2018em try harder. At least, that\u2019s what it felt like when I got diagnosed and started at the ADHD Treatment Center. After weeks of no progress with planning and organising tasks, my kind therapist kept encouraging me to try again, but I just kept walking into a wall. I couldn\u2019t do it. At first I cried a lot, because after a lifetime of failing at things that seem simple for everyone else, it stung that I couldn\u2019t even follow the therapy program specifically made for people with ADHD. But then it occurred to me: what if tech could replace some of the executive processes I struggle with, essentially outsourcing the task, giving me a piece of the brain \u2018normal\u2019 people have?  \n  \nThe relief when I got an auto-scheduling tool working for me\u2026 I can\u2019t even describe it. I use a calendar now. Me! With an actual planning that\u2019s automatically up-to-date the whole time. I know this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for anyone with normal executive functions, but I\u2019ve never had this. I still felt like the stupidest kid in ADHD-class that I couldn\u2019t do it the \u2018normal\u2019 way though, so I just said something offhand to my treatment coordinator at the Center, like: \u201cOh, by the way, the executive functioning coaching, I just couldn't do it, so I\u2019m having AI do it for me now.\u201d Waving a hand in the air, rolling my eyes at my own silly shortcomings, adopting this apologetic tone I often find myself using, basically saying; *I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m such an idiot I couldn\u2019t even do X, Y or Z, and sorry to be cheating on your program, it\u2019s me, not you, I\u2019m just incapable of doing anything correctly*. (Yeah, ADHD did a number on my self-esteem, which was one of my main reasons for seeking help.) To my horror, she told me she had a crying girl in her office recently who quit therapy because she, like me, \u2018just couldn\u2019t do it\u2019. In fact, patients with ADHD regularly get so desperate that they give up.  \n  \nThen I spoke to the psychologist giving the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to ADHD-patients and she estimated roughly half of her patients genuinely can\u2019t learn to plan by themselves. HALF! So I\u2019m not some strange outlier at all. When I told her about auto-scheduling, her eyebrows shot up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching people to plan manually, but if what you\u2019re saying exists\u2026 maybe we shouldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d  \n  \nSo here\u2019s the thing. I want this information to be out there on the internet for people like me, because we need it the most. And because most of the information on relevant planning tools that I found was written by and for neurotypicals. Neurotypicals seemingly like holistic approaches and pretty apps, sitting down with matcha tea or coffee in the morning for 15 minutes to plan their day. Good for them, but that option is a non-starter for my ADHD-brain. After 4 months with dexamphetamine, I\u2019ve also become a prescriber to the thought that \u2018pills don't build skills\u2019. I love my meds, they help so much with focus and they calm down my overactive chipmunk-like brain, but they\u2019re not made of actual magic. Pills can\u2019t give you an extra frontal lobe or a personality transplant. My executive skills are still weak or non-existent. Some of my issues are remarkably similar to people who experience brain damage after an accident, and when you think about it like a disability (like needing glasses, crutches or a hearing-aid) there\u2019s only so much that \u2018trying harder\u2019 or \u2018talking about how that makes you feel\u2019 can realistically accomplish.  \n  \n**IN SHORT (TL;DR)**  \nYes, auto-scheduling tools can take over the brain-process of planning and I believe this can be helpful for the ADHD-brains struggling with planning, task management and knowing where to start. Of all the tools out there for tasks and planning, I found only 5 that promised to take over for my brain and think for me, namely: Motion, Trevor, Atlas, Reclaim and Skedpal. I looked at all these apps, tested 4 of them, and found that my brain is currently only compatible with Reclaim. YMMV though; there are very good reviews from people with ADHD for Skedpal and Motion as well. I highly recommend auto-scheduling for people with ADHD who are spinning their wheels trying to learn how to plan.  \n  \n**MY HISTORY WITH PLANNING AND MY EXPERIENCE TESTING THE TOOLS**  \nTo explain how AI bridges the gap between what my brain can and can\u2019t do, I will describe the 4 steps of standardised executive functioning training that I received as part of my ADHD-treatment and what worked for me. There are huge differences in how ADHD manifests. Not everyone struggles to the same degree with the same things. Below, I\u2019ll describe my history with planning, the trouble I ran into in my life and therapy and the upper limits of what my brain can manage. Getting a feel for my type of ADHD should help to determine in what sort of situations auto-scheduling can be helpful. If my story doesn\u2019t spark recognition, some other tool might be a better fit.  \n  \nBelow the 4 therapy-steps, I describe my experience testing the 5 different tools and some of their specs/features. (Sorry, the first section is so long, skipping and scrolling down to the test-section is an option.)\n\n**Step 1: Pick a calendar and start using it.**  \nI felt a little uneasy when therapy started with this, because it reminded me of the first time I had to use a calendar in high school. I was almost 12 years old. The class-tutor handed out a bunch of papers with assignments from our teachers and told us to plan our homework in accordance with our schedule. Everybody grabbed their cute pocket diaries with pictures of ponies and cars, and started writing. Except for me. In the silent classroom, I tried to grasp what my classmates were doing, what they were looking at and how they all seemed to know what to write down, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Eventually, I shoved the papers away and leaned back in my chair. The tutor looked up, surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing? You need to plan your homework,\u201d he told me. I shrugged and said: \u201cI\u2019ll just remember it.\u201d He got angry, but I felt too embarrassed to admit that I was the only one who didn\u2019t \\*understand\\* the assignment, especially with the whole class listening.  \n  \nIn the end, I never learned how to plan, forgot assignments, didn\u2019t do the homework and was late a lot, which led to near-endless punishment for tardiness during my 6 years of high school. I cleaned the whole school more often than I can count and always thought that I would somehow get everything under control as I got older, but my last year was the worst by far. That year, a new ex-military headmaster digitised the system for recording lateness and ordered a crackdown. Teachers had to refuse entrance into the classroom if you were even a second late and if your school ID got scanned more than 5 minutes after the start of class, you were not allowed to enter anymore. The only scanner was attached to a computer all the way on the ground floor of the main building, so I always had to run there, find someone to operate and they had to start the system, which often led to time maxing out and me missing class. The first day of the crackdown, I got written up (well, scanned) SIX times. Dumbstruck, the headmaster asked how I\u2019d managed to do it. Truthfully, I had no idea. I just spaced out a lot and was surprised every time the bell rang and everyone stormed out of the classroom. Everyone, except for me. I still had to figure out how to declutter my little desk, how to fit everything in my backpack again, where I needed to go after that, not walk off in the wrong direction, that sort of thing.  \n  \nThe new rules led to a sharp drop in my attendance, which turned out to be illegal. Without ever meaning to, I was suddenly violating compulsory education laws and the government threatened community service for me and financial sanctions for my parents. The headmaster often had me called away from classes later in the day as well so I could receive new punishments that steadily grew in severity and duration from hours, to days, to weeks, to months and eventually to more daytime hours than were still left in the school year.  \n  \nThis all made sense, because if you punish a kid enough, they\u2019ll eventually learn how to plan, use a calendar, get more organised and be on time... right?\n\nWrong. I was missing so much class I was barely being taught anything anymore. Suddenly I found myself taking tests I never saw coming about subjects I never even heard about. I had to invent so many answers on the spot that one teacher started reading my 'hilarious' tests to his wife to make her laugh. My grades plummeted. I basically had to be on the school premises from dusk till dawn for all my detention-hours, even though I had to cycle to school for over 15 miles (and back) and had to work in the evenings. I stopped having breakfast, had no time for dinner before work, was always home late again and couldn\u2019t sleep enough because I had to get up in the middle of the night to report for duty in the headmaster\u2019s office long before sunrise. Somewhere in the meantime, I had to try and intercept the threatening letters from the government so I could hide them from my parents. Exhausted, I started daydreaming and messing up even more, which led to more threats, punishment, missed classes, forgotten assignments, bad grades, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t seem to improve. Even though I desperately wanted to. It was a Catch-22 situation.\n\nThe pressure was absurd and it\u2019s become a point of reference for me. If my brain had been capable of planning and getting organised, surely I would have learned then.\n\nInstead, I was in serious danger of not graduating at all, after a while. By that point, I was running around half-dressed, cycling in a skirt with bare legs and wet hair in the middle of winter, always in a panic, pale, underfed, with dark circles under my eyes, until a couple of teachers seemed to decide that enough was enough. One by one, they defied the headmaster by pretending they couldn\u2019t see me opening doors after the second bell and insisting my homework was suddenly always done (it wasn\u2019t). I had an excellent memory, so the simple act of letting me stay in their classrooms during the lessons catapulted me to the top of those respective classes. I graduated, but only thanks to their mercy.  \n  \nI had to keep showing up for punishment daily until I was excused a couple of weeks before the national final exams. Nobody ever seemed to question whether I was unorganised on purpose or if I \\*deserved\\* to be the kid who was punished more than anyone else in the school. It only seemed to confuse the obvious punks who were sometimes in detention with me for things like using graffiti on an outbuilding, sabotaging a teacher\u2019s car or building a bomb in an empty can of Pringles to blow up a toilet. The boys asked skeptically what boring little me could possibly have done that was so bad and their questions made sense; I was this polite girl in a skirt who would never even attempt to stick chewing gum under a desk. But I didn\u2019t know why or how everything went wrong all the time. Teachers had been punishing me ever since I was 5 when I regularly had to stand in the hallway outside the classroom for being late or loud, staying after school because my handwriting was supposedly bad on purpose, not trying hard enough to learn how to tie my shoes and failing, drifting off without finishing something, etc, etc.\n\nWhen I went to college for my bachelor\u2019s degree, I met the first person who realised I simply needed help. He also was a student and commented on my near-empty pocket diary; I\u2019d only scribbled in the games and training sessions with the sports team I\u2019d joined. He suddenly understood my repeated questions to the tune of \u2018Wait, what assignment? A deadline? TOMORROW?!\u2019 As the son of two psychologists, he connected my chronic lateness, the daydreaming, the clumsiness, the chaotic demeanour and the way I never seemed to stop moving with my bare dayplanner and he sat me down behind a computer to sign me up for Gmail and Google Calendar. He also introduced me to Wunderlist. He thought it would help with me losing and forgetting things all the time. It helped somewhat, especially when emails pertaining to events automatically started showing up in the Calendar. It was better than nothing, but it didn\u2019t change my style of dumpster-fire-management to \u2018plan\u2019 my day. (Or, more accurately: have the day happen to me in a blur.) Students with ADHD in college also started diagnosing me (almost from across the room sometimes) and spontaneously offered their Ritalin. They were an awesome bunch. Unfortunately, methylphenidate made me fall asleep in the middle of the day, so I thought it was a dead end.\n\nAfter college, I believe I was supposed to install and configure iCal for 2 separate professional jobs? I never got around to it. (The quality of my work was always good, so people thought it was odd, but nobody complained.)\n\nThrough the years, I started using Google Calendar more for birthdays, other recurring items, Facebook events, weddings, funerals and vacations. I tried to practise with appointments and reminders. This was a little hit and miss, especially because I still forgot to actually open Google Calendar and I also tended to not prepare for these happenings until the last minute. My husband, who met me when I was 25, attached his calendar to mine pretty soon in the relationship to help out, put things on my calendar and remind me of stuff. It didn't hurt that he has a top psychologist in his family, who noticed my ADHD without me even mentioning anything. Around the same time my husband heard an item on the radio about ADHD in women and called from the car yelling: \u201cYou have ADHD! You have all the symptoms! Everything! If you don\u2019t have it, I\u2019ll eat a hat. I\u2019ll eat a store filled with hats.\u201d I still didn't see the point of treatment then, but he\u2019s been operating as if I were already diagnosed ever since. In the years that followed, two of my siblings got diagnosed before me.  \n  \nSo that's my natural level of executive functioning. Technically, I have a calendar, and a husband who helps me use it. Mission accomplished. (Not really though).\n\n**Step 2: Gather all your tasks in one place.**  \nSo my therapist thought it was suboptimal for me to keep writing down tasks on my hand, in a few notebooks, in two separate bullet journals, on random pieces of papers lying around like envelopes and receipts, in Todoist, in Google Tasks and on post-its in many shades stuck everywhere. Go figure. She wanted me to pick 1 place. I glared at her. But the concept made sense.\n\nIt really happens too often that I lose a task because I throw away a piece of paper, a gust of wind blows an old post-it behind my desk or I accidentally use hand sanitizer dissolving the ink on my hand. That\u2019s just too silly. And that's in addition to the issue that I forget tasks simply because it's in a notebook I haven't opened in two weeks.\n\nSo I picked Todoist, because I already use it to make sense of small shared projects and I like it. I put most of my tasks in there (it\u2019s a lot). I also installed a large widget on my phone to quickly enter tasks in the inbox as soon as I think of them. It's been working pretty well.\n\n**Step 3: Add a simple 1-2-3 priority and deadlines to your tasks**  \nThis is where I started to feel nauseous. I\u2019ve never distinguished between tasks by different levels in priority. I only added an exclamation mark to a list every now and again, for tasks that needed to happen ASAP (so, last week).\n\nTo my surprise, and maybe thanks to the dexamphetamines I\u2019ve been prescribed, it wasn\u2019t as undoable as I thought. Turns out, Todoist has different colors for priorities (I vaguely noticed the feature before, but never used it). Grey for no priority, blue for Priority 3, orange for P2 and red for P1. The colors make sense to me. Gauging the priority of a task seems hard, but I can tell you what color a task is. I also know when a task has a real deadline and when one doesn\u2019t. It took some effort and I struggled a bit with focus and decision fatigue, but I got it done and was quite proud of myself. Until step 4.\n\n**Step 4: Each morning, review the priorities you\u2019ve assigned to your tasks, change priority levels, and plan your day and week accordingly.**  \nI had the biggest Error404. She wanted me to whatnow? I gave it a try. Stared at the list. Stared at the calendar. Went to get tea. Tried again. Got distracted for the rest of the day. Had to start over the next day because time had passed in which I\u2019d officially planned to do something else. Spent half the day trying to \u2018review the priority of tasks\u2019 to plan, but got distracted by a related tasks that I thought I could knock off quickly, but it took much longer than I anticipated and I ended up not doing what I should have done that day. Gave up. Showed up empty handed at the ADHD Treatment Centre after one week.\n\nThe second week yielded essentially the same result. After the third week, I hadn\u2019t even gotten around to giving it another go. My therapist was all encouraging words, reassuring me that setbacks were normal and that I just had to keep trying. But I already knew that this bar was too high. I felt resigned. I had such high hopes for ADHD-therapy and medication. I thought it would magically solve my problems and that somebody would finally tell me the secret to an organized life that had eluded me for all these years. Instead, the instructions were... very basic. And dexamphetamine did not enable me to sit down each day and just \u2018review\u2019 tasks and \u2018plan\u2019 my day and add \u2018time blocks\u2019. Like it\u2019s easy, instead of a mind bendingly complicated puzzle that would consume a considerable amount of mental energy at the start of each day. (Which is how I know it\u2019s never going to happen. I\u2019ve learned that I need something simple enough that I can do it on my worst day.)\n\nAfter 5 weeks without progress at the ADHD Treatment Centre, I mentioned that I sometimes use Goblin Tools to break down tasks. It helps me to figure out what has to be done, and it helps me get started. Goblin Tools was new for my therapist, so I heard myself explain it was just this website with AI that helps to break down tasks or figure out what to eat or how long something takes. I have it listed in my bookmarks bar in Google Chrome. When I left her office, I thought to myself that I needed a goblin \u00e1nd a pixy on my shoulder to tell me what to do. I stopped walking. What if pixies existed already as different AI tools?\n\n**Testing AI scheduling tools**  \nThere are many organisational apps, some of which are very sleek and advanced, like Monday, Sunsama and Akiflow. However; they still require you to plan your day manually and that\u2019s precisely the thing I struggle with. Which left me with Atlas AI, Trevor AI, Skedpal, Motion and Reclaim AI. (Purists will tell you that some of the software has as much to do with AI as the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, but for all intents and purposes, I\u2019m going to refer to it as AI because that\u2019s what we call it now even though it\u2019s technically not artificial intelligence. Before \u2018AI\u2019 became a hype people would just refer to this as auto-scheduling or smart scheduling.)  \n  \n**Atlas AI**  \nThis really is the most AI-rich of the selection. It looks promising for a lot more than schedule automation because its aim is to replace a real assistent, but it\u2019s still in beta and I found that my \u2018assistant\u2019 didn\u2019t always follow through. For instance, it can set timers, but it forgot to remind me when time was up, even though it said it would. It also planned only half of the appointments in Google Calendar that it said in black and white it would schedule. When I asked why this was the case, it replied that maybe it was my internet connection? Nice try, robot assistant who clearly learned everything from humans, including lying. Maybe next year or when it\u2019s not in beta anymore I'll give it another go, but right now, I can\u2019t afford for tasks and appointments to just disappear. (It\u2019s also going to be quite expensive and geared towards business use, not personal organisation, so it was a long shot anyway.)\n\nThis left the 4 candidates more clearly dedicated to auto-scheduling my tasks on Google Calendar; Trevor AI, Skedpal, Motion App and Reclaim AI.\n\n**Trevor AI**  \nTrevor is the official \u2018AI\u2019 partner of Todoist, so it made sense to try this one, but I thought integration wasn\u2019t that smooth. The \u2018smart scheduling\u2019 only happened after I accepted suggestions and that worked only for things I\u2019d attached a date to. I often don\u2019t add a solid deadline to tasks, so Trevor suggested that I buy a present for Fathers Day come June ASAP even though the task had no (=grey) priority attached and I did have much more pressing tasks at the time (this was back in april). I tried to get auto-scheduling to work, but found that I just had to drag tasks in myself to get what I wanted. I also couldn\u2019t really figure out how it would automatically adjust my schedule after, you know, life happened, even though that\u2019s listed as a feature. I got frustrated. Part of my tasks seemed to be missing. I actually tried twice and also removed Trevor twice.  \n  \nIf you prefer dragging tasks into a schedule yourself and only smart-schedule some items, or smart schedule by hand, this might be a decent option. But in that case, there are many other apps who assist with that, like Sunsama. A big part is also my brain. I couldn\u2019t intuitively use Trevor and kept clicking on the wrong things, had to undo scheduling, that sort of thing. My biggest issue was that I couldn't get fully automated scheduling to work, but that could be my fault. It\u2019s my impression Trever wasn\u2019t originally meant to do that though, it\u2019s more of a smart tool to help you see your tasks and your calendar side-by-side and decide what goes where, with some suggestions from Trevor.  \n  \nTrevor is relatively affordable. You can use a basic version for free, or upgrade for smart features all the Pro-features for $3.99/mo or $36/year.\n\n**Skedpal**  \nSkedpal is reasonably (medium) priced software for smart scheduling with a wide array of options and great reviews. Project management is one of the extra attractive features. But I also noticed the interface looks a little bare bones and dated. The instruction videos are 5 years old and the blog was deserted 2 years ago. I found some old information on an app that made it seem like it wasn\u2019t being updated? Skedpal is asking for 15 dollars a month or 10 dollars per month with a yearly subscription, which is decent, but not cheap. Ideally, you\u2019d pick the yearly option in this case, but the idea of paying 120 dollars up front for a tool that might have been quietly abandoned or won\u2019t receive updates anymore made me pause. If I\u2019m going to invest money and the time to learn how to use a tool, I\u2019d like to be able to trust that it\u2019s going be around in the coming years. So I put Skedpal on my Plan B-pile.   \n  \nHowever, I checked this today, to make sure, and noticed there were actually some recent tweets on X by Skedpal and also a message about beta-testing for Skedpal 3 last Januari. Skedpal is probably alive and well.I found various reviews for Skepal on social media, including from someone with ADHD, who said Skedpal worked better for them than Motion. This is saying something because there seems to be a consensus amongst reviewers that Motion is the best auto-scheduling tool on the market. It wasn\u2019t for me though. \n\n**Motion AI**  \nAfter reading all the positive reviews about the high price tag that was deemed to be worth it (34 dollars a month, or $19 p/m when billed annually), my expectations were high as well. I really spent time trying to get Motion to work for me in the trial week, installing Zapier, importing tasks, getting several different apps integrated, but I found Motion to be annoyingly glitchy. I'm not the only one complaining about it either, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't my computer this time.  \n  \nI ran into a particularly frustrating bug and I tried everything to solve it. I even changed the times in which tasks could be scheduled to free space to put something in, but it still wouldn\u2019t schedule it and kept showing a \u2018scheduling-conflict\u2019 for no reason. I could solve all the other \u2018scheduling conflicts\u2019 easily enough, but this block of 2 hours just wouldn\u2019t click into the free space for 2 hours and I couldn\u2019t find out why. I spent hours and hours, watched videos in an effort to troubleshoot, some twice, kept asking the AI on the Motion website what could be the problem and I really, really couldn\u2019t get it to work for me. (My frustration boiled over at one point; it wasn't pretty.)  \n  \nThe options on paper are amazing and endless. The task management feature is like Monday, with projects moving through stages, and it's automatized. Or you can star an important e-mail in Gmail, which can trigger Zapier to send it as a task to Motion, then Motion automatically puts it on your Calendar. (However, you could also add the e-mail to Google Tasks or Todiost via the buttons or plug-ins, and if those task managers are connected to any of the auto-scheduling tools listed here, the email would also show up on you Calendar.) It's enough to make anyone salivate.  \n  \nMotion is not a match for my brain though, in part because of the bug, but it also felt a bit rigid. The system prefers that you put tasks straight into Motion directly, which makes sense and is possible, but auto-schedulers obviously require information on a task, like priority, how much time you estimate a task would take and a deadline. In Motion, a task without that information won\u2019t be scheduled at all. But I know that I\u2019m the kind of person who shoots a half-finished thought in the Todoist inbox without adding details until later (though I could forget) and I also don\u2019t believe that every task needs those details (for instance, because it\u2019s low priority and would roughly take me an hour, which should be default). I also couldn\u2019t download/import tasks from Todoist and Google Tasks directly; only new ones or solo tasks came through with Zapier, and I spent a lot of time on that as well to get the prompts working. In the end, the tool was too hard for my brain to use and I also thought it wasn\u2019t worth the high price point for me. However: the price is considerably lower for teams and that\u2019s supposedly where Motion shines, also because of the project management with stages feature. I think it\u2019s not originally geared towards personal use.\n\n**Reclaim AI**  \nI was flabbergasted that Reclaim immediately worked for me, I didn't think it was going to happen anymore. It hadn\u2019t made the top of the list for me for several reasons. The look didn\u2019t appeal to me much, the only app is a web-app and reviewers online consistently declared Motion the better app. I also read on the internet in older posts that people were missing certain functions that Motion had, like automatically re-scheduling tasks you haven\u2019t marked as completed, or theming days for certain tasks, or how the program would prioritise longer tasks over urgent ones. So I'd written Reclaim off. But as soon as I tried Reclaim anyway, I stumbled across all the supposedly missing functions in the settings and instruction videos. Maybe the tool has been improved recently? Reclaim does still have an issue with recurring tasks from Todoist though. I didn't have those, so it wasn't an issue for me, but it probably is for a lot of people. Reclaim also leaves the big task management to other, existing apps and just plans everything. Motion and Skedpal do also incorporate project management within the tool. Reclaim seems to be geared a little more towards personal planning and also incorporating habits during the day, like taking a walk outside.\n\nHow visually attractive it is, is also easily adjusted (I\u2019d assumed you were stuck with hip shades of purple), but it's actually irrelevant. I\u2019m starting to feel like that\u2019s almost the best thing about it. Reclaim is much more a tool doing the thinking for you in the background, unseen. I don\u2019t really need to change my behaviour much. I\u2019m still using my own task manager to braindump in and Reclaim schedules everything in Google Calendar. Because the connection goes both ways, I technically don't have to open Reclaim at all. I\u2019ve taken to adding the estimated time a task will take in Todoist itself, but you can also do it in Reclaim or in Google Tasks if that's your task manager (Reclaim automatically sends you the shorthand when you connect Google Tasks). You can also change the default duration of tasks.  \n  \nFor the first time in my life, I have a fully planned schedule, exactly as I need it, in the time slots where I need it. Every day. Like a proper adult. I'm almost giddy. (Sure, I\u2019m still severely underestimating how long tasks will take, but I can just add time or the machine will automatically reschedule it for me. I\u2019ve set automatic rescheduling to after 1 day in the settings. Default is 3 days or only when time is added.) \n\nI know what to do and when. I can stop worrying about that thing that I\u2019m probably forgetting that I should really do first, because it\u2019s all there in Google Calendar. And whenever I disagree with the planning, I can change the priority in Todoist/Google Tasks, go to Reclaim directly and drag the task to where I need it, or bump the task down the list showing the order decided by Reclaim. So that's pretty flexible. If tasks need more time to complete, I can just add time or click on the + button. When I add an appointment in Google Calendar, Reclaim automatically reschedules my whole calendar. When I add a task in ToDoist or Google Tasks, it\u2019s automatically added to Google Calendar based on the priority and/or deadline I\u2019ve added to the task.\n\nWhen life happens and I only manage half the planned tasks that day (or much less), I used to have a brain-error and think \u2018oh no, I did all that hard work making a planning for the week for nothing, EVERYTHING IS RUINED\u2019. Seriously. But Reclaim just re-plans those tasks for the next day and shuffles everything else down the line. It\u2019s just so nice to not have to think about it myself. To actually see tasks planned in time-frames, making visual what I could achieve that week (and what is definitely outside of the realm of possibilities because time is a limited resource, no matter what my brain says). Having a schedule that's always up to date makes using a calendar a lot easier.  \n  \nI guess it was time, too. A long list of tasks never indicated anything to me anyway. Everything could be 5 minutes long or 10 hours long. Who knew? It felt abstract, even when I tried the Alastair Method in Bullet Journal. (Still my favourite way to do it manually on paper though, I just can't keep it up for more than 2 weeks.) Seeing all the tasks scheduled gives me more of a feeling of urgency that a static list doesn't. So not only do I know where to get started, on what and when, I actually get more done because I don\u2019t wake up thinking \u2018ooooh, another saturday\u2026 nothing planned\u2026 let\u2019s learn to make homemade blocks of soap even though I still have 10 bottles of shower gel left!\u2019  \n  \nYou can use Reclaim for free, surprisingly. I think it\u2019s currently the only one on this list that auto-schedules for free. Free use is possible with a few basic apps like Google Calendar and Google Tasks, which makes auto-scheduling accessible for students with ADHD as well. Use with more specialised apps, including Zapier and Todoist, or extra scheduling links (for booking online meetings with clients, for instance) require a subscription starting at $10 a month or $8 when billed yearly.  \n  \nI went back to my therapist and could tell her I made progress in a way I didn\u2019t think possible. So if this is you, don\u2019t give up hope yet and hold off on quitting therapy. See if there is a tool for you out there and how far it takes you.\n\nAny auto-scheduling tool will definitely have a learning curve for most people, and you do need to look at the settings to determine what you want the program to do. It will cost time to set up, so it's smart to get a feel whether or not a tool would work for you, if you'd be able to add a level of priority or deadline to tasks at some point and what you'd need the tool to do. But there are plenty of tutorials on the internet, both long and short to help you get started. Goblin Tools is also free and nice to use for breaking down tasks to help get started some more (I\u2019ll just put the links in a comment below). I hope that tools like these will continue to develop, so people who struggle with executive functioning can really lean on them. Just like glasses, a hearing aid or crutches.  \n  \nI hope this helps someone out there. Thanks for reading this insane amount of text.\n\nP.S. For simple recurring daily routines, I like the app Tiimo and a smart watch. But that\u2019s a different story. :)",

When someone can\u2019t walk, we give them a wheelchair. But when someone has trouble planning, we make \u2018em try harder. At least, that\u2019s what it felt like when I got diagnosed and started at the ADHD Treatment Center. After weeks of no progress with planning and organising tasks, my kind therapist kept encouraging me to try again, but I just kept walking into a wall. I couldn\u2019t do it. At first I cried a lot, because after a lifetime of failing at things that seem simple for everyone else, it stung that I couldn\u2019t even follow the therapy program specifically made for people with ADHD. But then it occurred to me: what if tech could replace some of the executive processes I struggle with, essentially outsourcing the task, giving me a piece of the brain \u2018normal\u2019 people have?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The relief when I got an auto-scheduling tool working for me\u2026 I can\u2019t even describe it. I use a calendar now. Me! With an actual planning that\u2019s automatically up-to-date the whole time. I know this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for anyone with normal executive functions, but I\u2019ve never had this. I still felt like the stupidest kid in ADHD-class that I couldn\u2019t do it the \u2018normal\u2019 way though, so I just said something offhand to my treatment coordinator at the Center, like: \u201cOh, by the way, the executive functioning coaching, I just couldn&amp;#39;t do it, so I\u2019m having AI do it for me now.\u201d Waving a hand in the air, rolling my eyes at my own silly shortcomings, adopting this apologetic tone I often find myself using, basically saying; &lt;em&gt;I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m such an idiot I couldn\u2019t even do X, Y or Z, and sorry to be cheating on your program, it\u2019s me, not you, I\u2019m just incapable of doing anything correctly&lt;/em&gt;. (Yeah, ADHD did a number on my self-esteem, which was one of my main reasons for seeking help.) To my horror, she told me she had a crying girl in her office recently who quit therapy because she, like me, \u2018just couldn\u2019t do it\u2019. In fact, patients with ADHD regularly get so desperate that they give up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I spoke to the psychologist giving the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to ADHD-patients and she estimated roughly half of her patients genuinely can\u2019t learn to plan by themselves. HALF! So I\u2019m not some strange outlier at all. When I told her about auto-scheduling, her eyebrows shot up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching people to plan manually, but if what you\u2019re saying exists\u2026 maybe we shouldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s the thing. I want this information to be out there on the internet for people like me, because we need it the most. And because most of the information on relevant planning tools that I found was written by and for neurotypicals. Neurotypicals seemingly like holistic approaches and pretty apps, sitting down with matcha tea or coffee in the morning for 15 minutes to plan their day. Good for them, but that option is a non-starter for my ADHD-brain. After 4 months with dexamphetamine, I\u2019ve also become a prescriber to the thought that \u2018pills don&amp;#39;t build skills\u2019. I love my meds, they help so much with focus and they calm down my overactive chipmunk-like brain, but they\u2019re not made of actual magic. Pills can\u2019t give you an extra frontal lobe or a personality transplant. My executive skills are still weak or non-existent. Some of my issues are remarkably similar to people who experience brain damage after an accident, and when you think about it like a disability (like needing glasses, crutches or a hearing-aid) there\u2019s only so much that \u2018trying harder\u2019 or \u2018talking about how that makes you feel\u2019 can realistically accomplish.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN SHORT (TL;DR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nYes, auto-scheduling tools can take over the brain-process of planning and I believe this can be helpful for the ADHD-brains struggling with planning, task management and knowing where to start. Of all the tools out there for tasks and planning, I found only 5 that promised to take over for my brain and think for me, namely: Motion, Trevor, Atlas, Reclaim and Skedpal. I looked at all these apps, tested 4 of them, and found that my brain is currently only compatible with Reclaim. YMMV though; there are very good reviews from people with ADHD for Skedpal and Motion as well. I highly recommend auto-scheduling for people with ADHD who are spinning their wheels trying to learn how to plan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY HISTORY WITH PLANNING AND MY EXPERIENCE TESTING THE TOOLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nTo explain how AI bridges the gap between what my brain can and can\u2019t do, I will describe the 4 steps of standardised executive functioning training that I received as part of my ADHD-treatment and what worked for me. There are huge differences in how ADHD manifests. Not everyone struggles to the same degree with the same things. Below, I\u2019ll describe my history with planning, the trouble I ran into in my life and therapy and the upper limits of what my brain can manage. Getting a feel for my type of ADHD should help to determine in what sort of situations auto-scheduling can be helpful. If my story doesn\u2019t spark recognition, some other tool might be a better fit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below the 4 therapy-steps, I describe my experience testing the 5 different tools and some of their specs/features. (Sorry, the first section is so long, skipping and scrolling down to the test-section is an option.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Pick a calendar and start using it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI felt a little uneasy when therapy started with this, because it reminded me of the first time I had to use a calendar in high school. I was almost 12 years old. The class-tutor handed out a bunch of papers with assignments from our teachers and told us to plan our homework in accordance with our schedule. Everybody grabbed their cute pocket diaries with pictures of ponies and cars, and started writing. Except for me. In the silent classroom, I tried to grasp what my classmates were doing, what they were looking at and how they all seemed to know what to write down, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Eventually, I shoved the papers away and leaned back in my chair. The tutor looked up, surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing? You need to plan your homework,\u201d he told me. I shrugged and said: \u201cI\u2019ll just remember it.\u201d He got angry, but I felt too embarrassed to admit that I was the only one who didn\u2019t *understand* the assignment, especially with the whole class listening.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I never learned how to plan, forgot assignments, didn\u2019t do the homework and was late a lot, which led to near-endless punishment for tardiness during my 6 years of high school. I cleaned the whole school more often than I can count and always thought that I would somehow get everything under control as I got older, but my last year was the worst by far. That year, a new ex-military headmaster digitised the system for recording lateness and ordered a crackdown. Teachers had to refuse entrance into the classroom if you were even a second late and if your school ID got scanned more than 5 minutes after the start of class, you were not allowed to enter anymore. The only scanner was attached to a computer all the way on the ground floor of the main building, so I always had to run there, find someone to operate and they had to start the system, which often led to time maxing out and me missing class. The first day of the crackdown, I got written up (well, scanned) SIX times. Dumbstruck, the headmaster asked how I\u2019d managed to do it. Truthfully, I had no idea. I just spaced out a lot and was surprised every time the bell rang and everyone stormed out of the classroom. Everyone, except for me. I still had to figure out how to declutter my little desk, how to fit everything in my backpack again, where I needed to go after that, not walk off in the wrong direction, that sort of thing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new rules led to a sharp drop in my attendance, which turned out to be illegal. Without ever meaning to, I was suddenly violating compulsory education laws and the government threatened community service for me and financial sanctions for my parents. The headmaster often had me called away from classes later in the day as well so I could receive new punishments that steadily grew in severity and duration from hours, to days, to weeks, to months and eventually to more daytime hours than were still left in the school year.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all made sense, because if you punish a kid enough, they\u2019ll eventually learn how to plan, use a calendar, get more organised and be on time... right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong. I was missing so much class I was barely being taught anything anymore. Suddenly I found myself taking tests I never saw coming about subjects I never even heard about. I had to invent so many answers on the spot that one teacher started reading my &amp;#39;hilarious&amp;#39; tests to his wife to make her laugh. My grades plummeted. I basically had to be on the school premises from dusk till dawn for all my detention-hours, even though I had to cycle to school for over 15 miles (and back) and had to work in the evenings. I stopped having breakfast, had no time for dinner before work, was always home late again and couldn\u2019t sleep enough because I had to get up in the middle of the night to report for duty in the headmaster\u2019s office long before sunrise. Somewhere in the meantime, I had to try and intercept the threatening letters from the government so I could hide them from my parents. Exhausted, I started daydreaming and messing up even more, which led to more threats, punishment, missed classes, forgotten assignments, bad grades, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t seem to improve. Even though I desperately wanted to. It was a Catch-22 situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pressure was absurd and it\u2019s become a point of reference for me. If my brain had been capable of planning and getting organised, surely I would have learned then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I was in serious danger of not graduating at all, after a while. By that point, I was running around half-dressed, cycling in a skirt with bare legs and wet hair in the middle of winter, always in a panic, pale, underfed, with dark circles under my eyes, until a couple of teachers seemed to decide that enough was enough. One by one, they defied the headmaster by pretending they couldn\u2019t see me opening doors after the second bell and insisting my homework was suddenly always done (it wasn\u2019t). I had an excellent memory, so the simple act of letting me stay in their classrooms during the lessons catapulted me to the top of those respective classes. I graduated, but only thanks to their mercy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to keep showing up for punishment daily until I was excused a couple of weeks before the national final exams. Nobody ever seemed to question whether I was unorganised on purpose or if I *deserved* to be the kid who was punished more than anyone else in the school. It only seemed to confuse the obvious punks who were sometimes in detention with me for things like using graffiti on an outbuilding, sabotaging a teacher\u2019s car or building a bomb in an empty can of Pringles to blow up a toilet. The boys asked skeptically what boring little me could possibly have done that was so bad and their questions made sense; I was this polite girl in a skirt who would never even attempt to stick chewing gum under a desk. But I didn\u2019t know why or how everything went wrong all the time. Teachers had been punishing me ever since I was 5 when I regularly had to stand in the hallway outside the classroom for being late or loud, staying after school because my handwriting was supposedly bad on purpose, not trying hard enough to learn how to tie my shoes and failing, drifting off without finishing something, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I went to college for my bachelor\u2019s degree, I met the first person who realised I simply needed help. He also was a student and commented on my near-empty pocket diary; I\u2019d only scribbled in the games and training sessions with the sports team I\u2019d joined. He suddenly understood my repeated questions to the tune of \u2018Wait, what assignment? A deadline? TOMORROW?!\u2019 As the son of two psychologists, he connected my chronic lateness, the daydreaming, the clumsiness, the chaotic demeanour and the way I never seemed to stop moving with my bare dayplanner and he sat me down behind a computer to sign me up for Gmail and Google Calendar. He also introduced me to Wunderlist. He thought it would help with me losing and forgetting things all the time. It helped somewhat, especially when emails pertaining to events automatically started showing up in the Calendar. It was better than nothing, but it didn\u2019t change my style of dumpster-fire-management to \u2018plan\u2019 my day. (Or, more accurately: have the day happen to me in a blur.) Students with ADHD in college also started diagnosing me (almost from across the room sometimes) and spontaneously offered their Ritalin. They were an awesome bunch. Unfortunately, methylphenidate made me fall asleep in the middle of the day, so I thought it was a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After college, I believe I was supposed to install and configure iCal for 2 separate professional jobs? I never got around to it. (The quality of my work was always good, so people thought it was odd, but nobody complained.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the years, I started using Google Calendar more for birthdays, other recurring items, Facebook events, weddings, funerals and vacations. I tried to practise with appointments and reminders. This was a little hit and miss, especially because I still forgot to actually open Google Calendar and I also tended to not prepare for these happenings until the last minute. My husband, who met me when I was 25, attached his calendar to mine pretty soon in the relationship to help out, put things on my calendar and remind me of stuff. It didn&amp;#39;t hurt that he has a top psychologist in his family, who noticed my ADHD without me even mentioning anything. Around the same time my husband heard an item on the radio about ADHD in women and called from the car yelling: \u201cYou have ADHD! You have all the symptoms! Everything! If you don\u2019t have it, I\u2019ll eat a hat. I\u2019ll eat a store filled with hats.\u201d I still didn&amp;#39;t see the point of treatment then, but he\u2019s been operating as if I were already diagnosed ever since. In the years that followed, two of my siblings got diagnosed before me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my natural level of executive functioning. Technically, I have a calendar, and a husband who helps me use it. Mission accomplished. (Not really though).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Gather all your tasks in one place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nSo my therapist thought it was suboptimal for me to keep writing down tasks on my hand, in a few notebooks, in two separate bullet journals, on random pieces of papers lying around like envelopes and receipts, in Todoist, in Google Tasks and on post-its in many shades stuck everywhere. Go figure. She wanted me to pick 1 place. I glared at her. But the concept made sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really happens too often that I lose a task because I throw away a piece of paper, a gust of wind blows an old post-it behind my desk or I accidentally use hand sanitizer dissolving the ink on my hand. That\u2019s just too silly. And that&amp;#39;s in addition to the issue that I forget tasks simply because it&amp;#39;s in a notebook I haven&amp;#39;t opened in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I picked Todoist, because I already use it to make sense of small shared projects and I like it. I put most of my tasks in there (it\u2019s a lot). I also installed a large widget on my phone to quickly enter tasks in the inbox as soon as I think of them. It&amp;#39;s been working pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Add a simple 1-2-3 priority and deadlines to your tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is where I started to feel nauseous. I\u2019ve never distinguished between tasks by different levels in priority. I only added an exclamation mark to a list every now and again, for tasks that needed to happen ASAP (so, last week).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, and maybe thanks to the dexamphetamines I\u2019ve been prescribed, it wasn\u2019t as undoable as I thought. Turns out, Todoist has different colors for priorities (I vaguely noticed the feature before, but never used it). Grey for no priority, blue for Priority 3, orange for P2 and red for P1. The colors make sense to me. Gauging the priority of a task seems hard, but I can tell you what color a task is. I also know when a task has a real deadline and when one doesn\u2019t. It took some effort and I struggled a bit with focus and decision fatigue, but I got it done and was quite proud of myself. Until step 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Each morning, review the priorities you\u2019ve assigned to your tasks, change priority levels, and plan your day and week accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI had the biggest Error404. She wanted me to whatnow? I gave it a try. Stared at the list. Stared at the calendar. Went to get tea. Tried again. Got distracted for the rest of the day. Had to start over the next day because time had passed in which I\u2019d officially planned to do something else. Spent half the day trying to \u2018review the priority of tasks\u2019 to plan, but got distracted by a related tasks that I thought I could knock off quickly, but it took much longer than I anticipated and I ended up not doing what I should have done that day. Gave up. Showed up empty handed at the ADHD Treatment Centre after one week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second week yielded essentially the same result. After the third week, I hadn\u2019t even gotten around to giving it another go. My therapist was all encouraging words, reassuring me that setbacks were normal and that I just had to keep trying. But I already knew that this bar was too high. I felt resigned. I had such high hopes for ADHD-therapy and medication. I thought it would magically solve my problems and that somebody would finally tell me the secret to an organized life that had eluded me for all these years. Instead, the instructions were... very basic. And dexamphetamine did not enable me to sit down each day and just \u2018review\u2019 tasks and \u2018plan\u2019 my day and add \u2018time blocks\u2019. Like it\u2019s easy, instead of a mind bendingly complicated puzzle that would consume a considerable amount of mental energy at the start of each day. (Which is how I know it\u2019s never going to happen. I\u2019ve learned that I need something simple enough that I can do it on my worst day.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 5 weeks without progress at the ADHD Treatment Centre, I mentioned that I sometimes use Goblin Tools to break down tasks. It helps me to figure out what has to be done, and it helps me get started. Goblin Tools was new for my therapist, so I heard myself explain it was just this website with AI that helps to break down tasks or figure out what to eat or how long something takes. I have it listed in my bookmarks bar in Google Chrome. When I left her office, I thought to myself that I needed a goblin \u00e1nd a pixy on my shoulder to tell me what to do. I stopped walking. What if pixies existed already as different AI tools?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing AI scheduling tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThere are many organisational apps, some of which are very sleek and advanced, like Monday, Sunsama and Akiflow. However; they still require you to plan your day manually and that\u2019s precisely the thing I struggle with. Which left me with Atlas AI, Trevor AI, Skedpal, Motion and Reclaim AI. (Purists will tell you that some of the software has as much to do with AI as the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, but for all intents and purposes, I\u2019m going to refer to it as AI because that\u2019s what we call it now even though it\u2019s technically not artificial intelligence. Before \u2018AI\u2019 became a hype people would just refer to this as auto-scheduling or smart scheduling.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlas AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThis really is the most AI-rich of the selection. It looks promising for a lot more than schedule automation because its aim is to replace a real assistent, but it\u2019s still in beta and I found that my \u2018assistant\u2019 didn\u2019t always follow through. For instance, it can set timers, but it forgot to remind me when time was up, even though it said it would. It also planned only half of the appointments in Google Calendar that it said in black and white it would schedule. When I asked why this was the case, it replied that maybe it was my internet connection? Nice try, robot assistant who clearly learned everything from humans, including lying. Maybe next year or when it\u2019s not in beta anymore I&amp;#39;ll give it another go, but right now, I can\u2019t afford for tasks and appointments to just disappear. (It\u2019s also going to be quite expensive and geared towards business use, not personal organisation, so it was a long shot anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This left the 4 candidates more clearly dedicated to auto-scheduling my tasks on Google Calendar; Trevor AI, Skedpal, Motion App and Reclaim AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nTrevor is the official \u2018AI\u2019 partner of Todoist, so it made sense to try this one, but I thought integration wasn\u2019t that smooth. The \u2018smart scheduling\u2019 only happened after I accepted suggestions and that worked only for things I\u2019d attached a date to. I often don\u2019t add a solid deadline to tasks, so Trevor suggested that I buy a present for Fathers Day come June ASAP even though the task had no (=grey) priority attached and I did have much more pressing tasks at the time (this was back in april). I tried to get auto-scheduling to work, but found that I just had to drag tasks in myself to get what I wanted. I also couldn\u2019t really figure out how it would automatically adjust my schedule after, you know, life happened, even though that\u2019s listed as a feature. I got frustrated. Part of my tasks seemed to be missing. I actually tried twice and also removed Trevor twice.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you prefer dragging tasks into a schedule yourself and only smart-schedule some items, or smart schedule by hand, this might be a decent option. But in that case, there are many other apps who assist with that, like Sunsama. A big part is also my brain. I couldn\u2019t intuitively use Trevor and kept clicking on the wrong things, had to undo scheduling, that sort of thing. My biggest issue was that I couldn&amp;#39;t get fully automated scheduling to work, but that could be my fault. It\u2019s my impression Trever wasn\u2019t originally meant to do that though, it\u2019s more of a smart tool to help you see your tasks and your calendar side-by-side and decide what goes where, with some suggestions from Trevor.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trevor is relatively affordable. You can use a basic version for free, or upgrade for smart features all the Pro-features for $3.99/mo or $36/year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skedpal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nSkedpal is reasonably (medium) priced software for smart scheduling with a wide array of options and great reviews. Project management is one of the extra attractive features. But I also noticed the interface looks a little bare bones and dated. The instruction videos are 5 years old and the blog was deserted 2 years ago. I found some old information on an app that made it seem like it wasn\u2019t being updated? Skedpal is asking for 15 dollars a month or 10 dollars per month with a yearly subscription, which is decent, but not cheap. Ideally, you\u2019d pick the yearly option in this case, but the idea of paying 120 dollars up front for a tool that might have been quietly abandoned or won\u2019t receive updates anymore made me pause. If I\u2019m going to invest money and the time to learn how to use a tool, I\u2019d like to be able to trust that it\u2019s going be around in the coming years. So I put Skedpal on my Plan B-pile.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I checked this today, to make sure, and noticed there were actually some recent tweets on X by Skedpal and also a message about beta-testing for Skedpal 3 last Januari. Skedpal is probably alive and well.I found various reviews for Skepal on social media, including from someone with ADHD, who said Skedpal worked better for them than Motion. This is saying something because there seems to be a consensus amongst reviewers that Motion is the best auto-scheduling tool on the market. It wasn\u2019t for me though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motion AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nAfter reading all the positive reviews about the high price tag that was deemed to be worth it (34 dollars a month, or $19 p/m when billed annually), my expectations were high as well. I really spent time trying to get Motion to work for me in the trial week, installing Zapier, importing tasks, getting several different apps integrated, but I found Motion to be annoyingly glitchy. I&amp;#39;m not the only one complaining about it either, so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it wasn&amp;#39;t my computer this time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into a particularly frustrating bug and I tried everything to solve it. I even changed the times in which tasks could be scheduled to free space to put something in, but it still wouldn\u2019t schedule it and kept showing a \u2018scheduling-conflict\u2019 for no reason. I could solve all the other \u2018scheduling conflicts\u2019 easily enough, but this block of 2 hours just wouldn\u2019t click into the free space for 2 hours and I couldn\u2019t find out why. I spent hours and hours, watched videos in an effort to troubleshoot, some twice, kept asking the AI on the Motion website what could be the problem and I really, really couldn\u2019t get it to work for me. (My frustration boiled over at one point; it wasn&amp;#39;t pretty.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The options on paper are amazing and endless. The task management feature is like Monday, with projects moving through stages, and it&amp;#39;s automatized. Or you can star an important e-mail in Gmail, which can trigger Zapier to send it as a task to Motion, then Motion automatically puts it on your Calendar. (However, you could also add the e-mail to Google Tasks or Todiost via the buttons or plug-ins, and if those task managers are connected to any of the auto-scheduling tools listed here, the email would also show up on you Calendar.) It&amp;#39;s enough to make anyone salivate.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motion is not a match for my brain though, in part because of the bug, but it also felt a bit rigid. The system prefers that you put tasks straight into Motion directly, which makes sense and is possible, but auto-schedulers obviously require information on a task, like priority, how much time you estimate a task would take and a deadline. In Motion, a task without that information won\u2019t be scheduled at all. But I know that I\u2019m the kind of person who shoots a half-finished thought in the Todoist inbox without adding details until later (though I could forget) and I also don\u2019t believe that every task needs those details (for instance, because it\u2019s low priority and would roughly take me an hour, which should be default). I also couldn\u2019t download/import tasks from Todoist and Google Tasks directly; only new ones or solo tasks came through with Zapier, and I spent a lot of time on that as well to get the prompts working. In the end, the tool was too hard for my brain to use and I also thought it wasn\u2019t worth the high price point for me. However: the price is considerably lower for teams and that\u2019s supposedly where Motion shines, also because of the project management with stages feature. I think it\u2019s not originally geared towards personal use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reclaim AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nI was flabbergasted that Reclaim immediately worked for me, I didn&amp;#39;t think it was going to happen anymore. It hadn\u2019t made the top of the list for me for several reasons. The look didn\u2019t appeal to me much, the only app is a web-app and reviewers online consistently declared Motion the better app. I also read on the internet in older posts that people were missing certain functions that Motion had, like automatically re-scheduling tasks you haven\u2019t marked as completed, or theming days for certain tasks, or how the program would prioritise longer tasks over urgent ones. So I&amp;#39;d written Reclaim off. But as soon as I tried Reclaim anyway, I stumbled across all the supposedly missing functions in the settings and instruction videos. Maybe the tool has been improved recently? Reclaim does still have an issue with recurring tasks from Todoist though. I didn&amp;#39;t have those, so it wasn&amp;#39;t an issue for me, but it probably is for a lot of people. Reclaim also leaves the big task management to other, existing apps and just plans everything. Motion and Skedpal do also incorporate project management within the tool. Reclaim seems to be geared a little more towards personal planning and also incorporating habits during the day, like taking a walk outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How visually attractive it is, is also easily adjusted (I\u2019d assumed you were stuck with hip shades of purple), but it&amp;#39;s actually irrelevant. I\u2019m starting to feel like that\u2019s almost the best thing about it. Reclaim is much more a tool doing the thinking for you in the background, unseen. I don\u2019t really need to change my behaviour much. I\u2019m still using my own task manager to braindump in and Reclaim schedules everything in Google Calendar. Because the connection goes both ways, I technically don&amp;#39;t have to open Reclaim at all. I\u2019ve taken to adding the estimated time a task will take in Todoist itself, but you can also do it in Reclaim or in Google Tasks if that&amp;#39;s your task manager (Reclaim automatically sends you the shorthand when you connect Google Tasks). You can also change the default duration of tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I have a fully planned schedule, exactly as I need it, in the time slots where I need it. Every day. Like a proper adult. I&amp;#39;m almost giddy. (Sure, I\u2019m still severely underestimating how long tasks will take, but I can just add time or the machine will automatically reschedule it for me. I\u2019ve set automatic rescheduling to after 1 day in the settings. Default is 3 days or only when time is added.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know what to do and when. I can stop worrying about that thing that I\u2019m probably forgetting that I should really do first, because it\u2019s all there in Google Calendar. And whenever I disagree with the planning, I can change the priority in Todoist/Google Tasks, go to Reclaim directly and drag the task to where I need it, or bump the task down the list showing the order decided by Reclaim. So that&amp;#39;s pretty flexible. If tasks need more time to complete, I can just add time or click on the + button. When I add an appointment in Google Calendar, Reclaim automatically reschedules my whole calendar. When I add a task in ToDoist or Google Tasks, it\u2019s automatically added to Google Calendar based on the priority and/or deadline I\u2019ve added to the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When life happens and I only manage half the planned tasks that day (or much less), I used to have a brain-error and think \u2018oh no, I did all that hard work making a planning for the week for nothing, EVERYTHING IS RUINED\u2019. Seriously. But Reclaim just re-plans those tasks for the next day and shuffles everything else down the line. It\u2019s just so nice to not have to think about it myself. To actually see tasks planned in time-frames, making visual what I could achieve that week (and what is definitely outside of the realm of possibilities because time is a limited resource, no matter what my brain says). Having a schedule that&amp;#39;s always up to date makes using a calendar a lot easier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it was time, too. A long list of tasks never indicated anything to me anyway. Everything could be 5 minutes long or 10 hours long. Who knew? It felt abstract, even when I tried the Alastair Method in Bullet Journal. (Still my favourite way to do it manually on paper though, I just can&amp;#39;t keep it up for more than 2 weeks.) Seeing all the tasks scheduled gives me more of a feeling of urgency that a static list doesn&amp;#39;t. So not only do I know where to get started, on what and when, I actually get more done because I don\u2019t wake up thinking \u2018ooooh, another saturday\u2026 nothing planned\u2026 let\u2019s learn to make homemade blocks of soap even though I still have 10 bottles of shower gel left!\u2019  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use Reclaim for free, surprisingly. I think it\u2019s currently the only one on this list that auto-schedules for free. Free use is possible with a few basic apps like Google Calendar and Google Tasks, which makes auto-scheduling accessible for students with ADHD as well. Use with more specialised apps, including Zapier and Todoist, or extra scheduling links (for booking online meetings with clients, for instance) require a subscription starting at $10 a month or $8 when billed yearly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to my therapist and could tell her I made progress in a way I didn\u2019t think possible. So if this is you, don\u2019t give up hope yet and hold off on quitting therapy. See if there is a tool for you out there and how far it takes you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any auto-scheduling tool will definitely have a learning curve for most people, and you do need to look at the settings to determine what you want the program to do. It will cost time to set up, so it&amp;#39;s smart to get a feel whether or not a tool would work for you, if you&amp;#39;d be able to add a level of priority or deadline to tasks at some point and what you&amp;#39;d need the tool to do. But there are plenty of tutorials on the internet, both long and short to help you get started. Goblin Tools is also free and nice to use for breaking down tasks to help get started some more (I\u2019ll just put the links in a comment below). I hope that tools like these will continue to develop, so people who struggle with executive functioning can really lean on them. Just like glasses, a hearing aid or crutches.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone out there. Thanks for reading this insane amount of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. For simple recurring daily routines, I like the app Tiimo and a smart watch. But that\u2019s a different story. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I often wear clothes until they are very worn out and bordering on socially unacceptable.  I also have gained weight and changed shape since giving birth to two kiddos, so most of my clothes don't even fit me any more.  My boss is making noise about dressing more professionally but it's so hard and stressful for me to go clothes shopping that I haven't made much progress.  \n\nI have read about \"capsule wardrobes\" and would love some help putting together stuff.  I think what would be most helpful would be very specific recommendations for clothing items.  I get decision fatigue quickly, so it's not helpful to say things like, \"You can find nice work clothes at Maurice's\" or whatever.  I really want folks to tell me, \"Look at these two specific shirts and this pair of pants at X brand.\"\n\nAbout my style (or lack thereof):\n\n* I am a cis gendered 38 yo woman who doesn't really like or follow feminine gender norms.  I prefer to dress androgynously or in men's clothing because it tends to made with higher quality, more durable fabric, be more comfortable to wear, and have usable pockets.  I am looking for brands that aren't fast fashion, sell durable, comfortable, practical clothing that will look acceptable in a business casual setting. \n* I have sensory issues around synthetic fabrics and pretty much need everything to be at least 60% (preferably higher) natural fibers like cotton or wool. \n* I prefer dark fabrics or darker busy prints because I have two small kids and the clothes need to be good at hiding stains.\n* Clothes need to be easy to care for (i.e. can be tossed in the wash without any special care needs) because I don't have the attention span to make sure things are hung flat to dry or whatever.\n* I would super love recommendations for brands that don't use sweatshops and provide living wages to their employees.  (I know this last bit is hard in today's fashion industry, so as long as it meets my other needs, this one is not mandatory.)\n\nI am totally happy to buy 5 pairs of the same style shirt in different colors.  I get decision fatigue picking out clothes to wear everyday, so less thinking is better.  I need to acquire 7-10 shirts, 3-4 pairs of pants, 3-4 sweaters, and a light jacket for everyday office wear and probably two sets of dress clothes for fancier occasions.  My job has me doing everything from standing out in cow fields talking to farmers to meeting with local and state politicians to ask them for money for our programs.  Mostly I sit at a desk all day.  \n\nI appreciate your recommendations!  I know that even though clothes shopping is the worst thing ever for me, that it must be some of y'all's hyperfocus thing.

I prefer to dress androgynously or in men&amp;#39;s clothing because it tends to made with higher quality, more durable fabric, be more comfortable to wear, and have usable pockets.  I am looking for brands that aren&amp;#39;t fast fashion, sell durable, comfortable, practical clothing that will look acceptable in a business casual setting. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have sensory issues around synthetic fabrics and pretty much need everything to be at least 60% (preferably higher) natural fibers like cotton or wool. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I prefer dark fabrics or darker busy prints because I have two small kids and the clothes need to be good at hiding stains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clothes need to be easy to care for (i.e. can be tossed in the wash without any special care needs) because I don&amp;#39;t have the attention span to make sure things are hung flat to dry or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I would super love recommendations for brands that don&amp;#39;t use sweatshops and provide living wages to their employees.  (I know this last bit is hard in today&amp;#39;s fashion industry, so as long as it meets my other needs, this one is not mandatory.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am totally happy to buy 5 pairs of the same style shirt in different colors.  I get decision fatigue picking out clothes to wear everyday, so less thinking is better.  I need to acquire 7-10 shirts, 3-4 pairs of pants, 3-4 sweaters, and a light jacket for everyday office wear and probably two sets of dress clothes for fancier occasions.  My job has me doing everything from standing out in cow fields talking to farmers to meeting with local and state politicians to ask them for money for our programs.  Mostly I sit at a desk all day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your recommendations!  I know that even though clothes shopping is the worst thing ever for me, that it must be some of y&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;s hyperfocus thing.  Thanks for your help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019ve been pushing myself too hard lately, didn\u2019t take my meds this morning, and showed up a bit frazzled to see my new psychiatrist (taking over for the previous doc that left). She\u2019s asking a few general questions and gets to \u201chow are you feeling today?\u201d and without skipping a beat I said \u201cwhat are my choices?\u201d. She looked at me like wha? and my awkward self actually made eye contact (rare) and just kept staring like she\u2019s the one being weird for not giving me a short list and she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m the one being weird cuz I am. It was so awkward but we both had a good laugh afterwards when I could provide more context. It ended up being a great visit and honestly I was a little nervous about a new person.

This is so long, and that\u2019s not helpful in this community, but I just really need feedback on what happened to me. \n\nSo thanks to the ologies podcast and the encouragement of people in my life, I started the diagnosis process with a local provider group recommended to me by a friend. I chose a provider there and moved forward. I purposely picked someone I could see in person, but they moved two appointments (pre and post testing) online and weren\u2019t present at the actual testing appointment. After the first appt, at which I was told someone would be in touch to collect my insurance and schedule testing in person, they did not get back to me for months. (Side note: I provided them my insurance information at least THREE times during this process. It never changed. They just kept losing it or not communicating internally or something?) \n\nAfter this appt and not hearing back for weeks, I called and emailed, frustrated that they were literally leaving the legwork to someone trying to get diagnosed with executive functioning and task completion problems. I didn\u2019t get a call or email back. Guys, they actually BILLED ME before they ever responded to any of my communication. Eventually I got an email asking for my insurance (again \ud83d\ude44) but this time also with the opportunity to schedule my testing appointment. My initial appointment was December. I heard back about this in February. I should have just started over with another office but I was afraid I would drop the ball so I signed up. \n\nTesting was fine. The therapist wasn\u2019t there and the girl who took me back was kind of weird. Instead of setting aside personnel to talk to my husband personally and privately, the girl kind of furtively asked him some questions in the waiting room while she showed me the bathroom. Clearly the questions were relevant because they showed up in my report, but she made it seem like she was just making awkward conversation, rather than making it clear that it was also part of the process that was clinically relevant. \n\nAgain, didn\u2019t hear back for a while, but eventually made an appointment to go over the results in March. Therapist moved that appt online for no good reason except that I was the only person scheduled to go to the office and she wanted to go home, as far as I remember. I got her report WEEKS after this follow up appointment (I was supposed to receive it right after but she sent it to the wrong email??? Even though she had emailed me before?? Honestly in hindsight this is even more ridiculous than it seemed at the time. Not to mention the privacy risk.) \n\nOk so to sum up the appointment, the therapist basically tells me that the only adhd related questionnaire I had taken was invalid, which can actually be a symptom because I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to be consistent. The other questionnaires measured other skills and potential diagnoses, but apparently were all above average because my IQ, which I didn\u2019t know was being tested, was high enough that every skill was just going to be at least average even if I was used to it being better. Basically if you tested 100 for IQ, then a skill below 80 showed difficulty. But I tested above that, so I had almost no skills as low as 80. The obvious adjustments weren\u2019t really made, she just told me I was functioning about as well as some people could hope to, even though it was possible for me to function better. That didn\u2019t seem like a problem to her. \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come across braggy-this is just what she told me. I suspect that because a lot of adhd diagnosed folks are initially seen as bright but distracted, this is a problem for some of y\u2019all as well. Anyway, because of this, the therapist pretty much said that if I still felt like I was struggling after seeing these results, I could move forward-but not in any clear direction. (The report listed a couple options that were honestly insulting. Things like meditating and seeing a therapist. I asked about medication and she said if I felt like it was necessary, I could try it? But with no direction on how I would go about that, since she couldn\u2019t prescribe.) That was so invalidating to me, because I wasn\u2019t going to self diagnose, and she pretty much told me that I was smart enough that my struggles didn\u2019t really matter. \n\nOk so last thing, I promise. When I finally did get the written report, it was written like Kindergarten reader, except tragic. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how these reports are usually written, but I wanted to cry. The whole thing was so dehumanizing and invalidating. Here\u2019s an exerpt (this is like 20% of the \u201cbackstory\u201d portion of the report. It just goes on and on exactly like this.): \n\n\u201cShe needs a lot of sleep.  She needs 8 hours minimum.  She is tired throughout the day.  She stopped drinking coffee for a while, and she had more energy.  She is drinking coffee again now.  She takes naps a couple of times per week. She usually is independent with hygiene and chores, but it is a major task.  She does not like how much effort it takes.  She has trouble with following routines.  She is horrible with chores and does them in bursts.  She has trouble getting around to tasks. Her husband does the dishes.  She does the laundry but does not finish the laundry.  Her house is messy.  She has clean clothing lying around the house all the time.   She loves to cook but she cannot plan for meals or for shopping.  She can throw dishes together.  She has trouble with returning messages.  She is trying to do better now that she is married.  She is trying to do better with appointments and bills.  She relies upon her husband for a lot of help with bills and paperwork tasks.  She must put forth more effort than others.  She has adequate computer skills and she is also a good driver.\u201d\n\nLike it just makes me feel like a horrible person to even start to read this report, which the therapist LITERALLY ASKED ME TO EDIT FOR CHANGES I WANTED AND ERRORS. \n\nWhat is wrong with this process? And I still want to know, what is wrong with me? I already struggle with decision fatigue so much, and now I have to diagnose myself with no training?\n\nI didn\u2019t reply to the email containing the report. She never followed up.",

I\u2019ve never been more organized in my life! \n\nHowever, I\u2019m still struggling with eating. I genuinely forget to eat. And for all my life I have never had those hunger pangs or that growly stomach thing most people have. I also have severe anxiety and eating has been a problem since I was a child. I was always anxious and literally my hands would be shaking, and that anxiety would make me nauseous and I would just never eat well. Along with my family pressuring me sometimes or commenting about my lack of eating, food has just always been a topic I didn\u2019t want to think about. But I\u2019m also on medication for that now as well, so I honestly thought it would all be good now. But I just forget to eat! \n\nI think it\u2019s a mix of being so happy to be able to focus on things and a bit of time blindness?? I only realize I need food because I start feeling weak, tired, and sometimes dizzy; but still no hunger pang. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m a terrible cook. I try my best but my food kind of just sucks. Cooking is a little overwhelming for me. My fried rice is passably edible. But recently, I\u2019ve learned I\u2019m prediabetic (extremely large family history of diabetes, so it\u2019s not a surprise). My dad had diabetes in his late twenties. And there are diabetics in both my maternal and paternal side. I need to take care of my health and I can\u2019t just rely on cereal, bread, ramen, and fruits. \n\nI don\u2019t even really know what I\u2019m asking anymore. I\u2019m just lost and don\u2019t know where to start. What do I buy, what can I cook, how can I make sure I eat? Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it? Is cooking overwhelming to others as well? Are there some free resources about some healthy meals that even a child can\u2019t mess up? I\u2019m sorry if this all seems kind of silly, I swear I am an adult and this is a genuine question! I\u2019m sorry that this is also all over the place, I just wanted to really explain my situation well!",

Being diagnosed and getting the help I need in my twenties has been a lifesaver. I\u2019ve never been more organized in my life! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I\u2019m still struggling with eating. I genuinely forget to eat. And for all my life I have never had those hunger pangs or that growly stomach thing most people have. I also have severe anxiety and eating has been a problem since I was a child. I was always anxious and literally my hands would be shaking, and that anxiety would make me nauseous and I would just never eat well. Along with my family pressuring me sometimes or commenting about my lack of eating, food has just always been a topic I didn\u2019t want to think about. But I\u2019m also on medication for that now as well, so I honestly thought it would all be good now. But I just forget to eat! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it\u2019s a mix of being so happy to be able to focus on things and a bit of time blindness?? I only realize I need food because I start feeling weak, tired, and sometimes dizzy; but still no hunger pang. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I\u2019m a terrible cook. I try my best but my food kind of just sucks. Cooking is a little overwhelming for me. My fried rice is passably edible. But recently, I\u2019ve learned I\u2019m prediabetic (extremely large family history of diabetes, so it\u2019s not a surprise). My dad had diabetes in his late twenties. And there are diabetics in both my maternal and paternal side. I need to take care of my health and I can\u2019t just rely on cereal, bread, ramen, and fruits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t even really know what I\u2019m asking anymore. I\u2019m just lost and don\u2019t know where to start. What do I buy, what can I cook, how can I make sure I eat? Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it? Is cooking overwhelming to others as well? Are there some free resources about some healthy meals that even a child can\u2019t mess up? I\u2019m sorry if this all seems kind of silly, I swear I am an adult and this is a genuine question! I\u2019m sorry that this is also all over the place, I just wanted to really explain my situation well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Apologies in advance for the length.\n\nTL;DR I have ADHD and so does my coworker, but she's not communicating at all with anyone or meeting many deadlines. I have no authority over her but need to figure out how to approach her about it since her lack of productivity is negatively affecting my mental health/work performance.\n\nI (26F) have ADHD, and so does my coworker (30sF). We're both medicated. Together, we make up the (very) small comms team for a startup. She handles a lot of the creative side (graphic design mainly for socials, emails, our site, the works) along with a design every other month or so from another department. I write copy, pull and analyze data, and basically anything else that needs doing. It's a fast-paced environment and meeting deadlines is really important for us.\n\nAlmost everyone at our company works remotely, and Slack has been our main method of communication for years now. My coworker is awful at responding to messages, no matter how urgent. It's better some months than others, but generally, I rarely get anything from her on time, if at all. We have incredibly low production goals for our department. These include 3-ish emails a week, maybe one social post a week (if at all), and maybe a blog post or two every month. That's it. I write all of the content, start designing the posts/any graphics probably to about 70% completion (It's an ugly mockup but she makes it pretty since she knows more than me\u2014she's said this helps her tremendously), and then hand them over to her to clean up. I'm trying to eliminate as much decision fatigue as possible and hopefully speed up the process by doing all this for her, but we're still not meeting our metrics.\n\nShe's constantly forgetting about meetings too. She often leaves me hanging as the only comms person in our weekly update meetings with other departments. Because she never responds to any of my messages, I can never give other departments any updates once I hand her something to finish. \n\nIt's incredibly helpful/vindicating I think for both of us to have a coworker who's so forthcoming about constant ADHD struggles, especially at a conventional 9-5 office job. I've missed deadlines before and been very transparent about it, but never as often and as consistently as her. I'm constantly faced with the choice of just doing it so we meet the deadline or letting it stay unfinished and having our \"department\" look bad in front of the rest of the company. I'm harboring some resentment about that.  I need to do so much to manage *my* time/deadlines, and managing her time/deadlines too is just too much for me. I'm feeling myself creeping up on burnout.\n\nHow can I bring this up to her in the most compassionate way that still articulates my frustrations? I've told my manager over and over, but he's not the most understanding when it comes to ADHD and nothing he's tried has helped so far. I've tried mentioning her in DMs or bigger channels, texting her, emailing, calling, etc., just to get something, *anything* from her but if she does respond, she does so hours later and/or after a deadline's passed. I want to be understanding of her difficulties because I get it. I struggle with getting things done too. But when no one can get in touch with her and deadlines are consistently being missed, there's a problem. I get that productivity can be difficult for people with ADHD, I struggle too. But I need a coworker who can at least pull some of her weight so I don't go crazy. Am I overreacting or being too harsh? What should I tell her? I don't want her to get fired. She's an awesome coworker and is great at what she does when she actually does it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should add: she's been working remotely for several years, so this isn't a new work environment for her. We don't talk to each other while we work either, like on a call or anything. Ideally, we'll have a quick morning check-in to set daily priorities but those haven't been happening regularly for months now. Apart from standard life stuff, nothing is wrong. She's like this no matter what she has going on outside of work. Thanks again in advance for any advice you can offer.",

In what ways did they help you? Did they help you with tips and techniques?\nI am looking for a therapist to specifically help with my ADHD, and I am just worried my expectations are a bit skewed of what I can actually realistically find.*\n\n-\n\nHi, I\u2019ve been going to therapy for a long time now for other mental health issues. I got diagnosed with ADHD probably about 2-3 years ago. I was seeing a therapist at the time (and still do), but the focus has never been on my ADHD.\n\nMy symptoms have gotten significantly worse, and I have realized a lot of my other mental health issues are SIGNIFICANTLY worsened by my ADHD. ADHD plays a huge role in a lot of my mental illnesses, so I think I need to pivot and put my energy into controlling that. My whole life no one ever suspected I had ADHD, and like I said, even after my diagnosis there was no focus on that, so I don\u2019t really have many coping strategies or techniques in my arsenal and it\u2019s becoming glaringly obvious.\n\nTherefore, I am trying to find a therapist that is knowledgeable in ADHD. I would LOVE to see an ADHD coach, and I think that would be the most helpful thing for me, but I just can\u2019t afford one right now. There aren\u2019t any therapists in my area (that take my insurance) that like actually SPECIALIZE in ADHD either. There are a lot that \u201chave experience with/see clients that have\u201d ADHD though, so that\u2019s kind of who I am wading through.\n\nMy question is, for those of you that see or have seen a therapist primarily or partially for ADHD, what was your experience? What should my expectations be for a good therapist with experience working with ADHD clients?\n\nBecause what I am ideally looking for is someone who has some general knowledge in what is/can be helpful for ADHDers. Someone knowledgeable in little techniques and coping skills, someone who understands how our mind works. Like someone who understands that just telling me to get a planner and get organized isn\u2019t going to work, and I might need a little trick or technique. Someone who already understands things like time blindness, executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, things like that. And even if they don\u2019t know every little thing, someone willing to do a little research. Someone willing to brainstorm with me.\n\nIs that expecting too much? Is that too much like an ADHD coach? Obviously I will need them for your average therapist type issues too, but ADHD is a big source of my anxiety and my depression. It triggers my OCD when my ADHD is out of control. So like this is a huge part of what I need from treatment if I actually want to make progress, otherwise I\u2019m just going to continue being stuck in this endless cycle.\nI\u2019m just worried I\u2019m asking too much, especially from therapists that aren\u2019t even specialists in ADHD.\n\nSo what does therapy look like for you (in regards to your ADHD)? Are these the kinds of things your therapists help you with too?",

Even better\u2014 these folks all come from a \u2018shit hole country\u2019 (at least in the eyes of the very people pushing all the above BS). Like I just don\u2019t get how folks who have directly experienced so much systemic racism can act like this but here we are.\n\nWork is taking a lot. Decided I could work from here, but that\u2019s resulted in me working until midnight due to the time change. SO ANGRY with myself that I thought this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n\nSimilarly, I volunteered/was volunteered to run a stupid game night. If I get one more nitpicky message from these folks, I\u2019m gonna loose it. I have 8 meetings today that go until midnight\u2014 I am SO ANGRY at myself for creating this situation for myself.\n\nFeels like I\u2019m being pulled in all these directions and don\u2019t have the spoons to deal with it. I have decision fatigue so even a simple \u2018what do you want for lunch\u2019 makes me want to freak out.\n\nThank you for reading",

Love my MIL but all the men are toxic af. Lots of \u2018that\u2019s gay\u2019 comments and talk of warning: transphobia chopping off dicks. We\u2019re in Florida and I\u2019m from CA. Even better\u2014 these folks all come from a \u2018shit hole country\u2019 (at least in the eyes of the very people pushing all the above BS). Like I just don\u2019t get how folks who have directly experienced so much systemic racism can act like this but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work is taking a lot. Decided I could work from here, but that\u2019s resulted in me working until midnight due to the time change. SO ANGRY with myself that I thought this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I volunteered/was volunteered to run a stupid game night. If I get one more nitpicky message from these folks, I\u2019m gonna loose it. I have 8 meetings today that go until midnight\u2014 I am SO ANGRY at myself for creating this situation for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feels like I\u2019m being pulled in all these directions and don\u2019t have the spoons to deal with it. I have decision fatigue so even a simple \u2018what do you want for lunch\u2019 makes me want to freak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Also sorry about the flair; it seemed like the best fit, since I'm an undiagnosed baby talking about my specific struggle in the form of a question.\n\n\\------------------------------\n\nOkay, I tried several times to start this post with a direct \"do you feel like this\" question, but I can't make it work without explaining what I mean through a personal example, so please forgive me for starting with my own story.\n\nI'm 30F, professional academic and impostor supreme. I went into talk-therapy for the first time about 2 years ago, to deal with a rough depressive episode / breakdown exacerbated by difficult life circumstances. I recently started working with a new therapist, following suggestions that the challenges I've been dealing with my entire life might actually be undiagnosed and mismanaged ADHD. One of my therapist's hypotheses is that my depression and anxiety are the result of self-punishment and bad coping mechanisms I came up with to work around the executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and all the other fun stuff this group talks about.\n\nI'm currently in the process of doing a lot of talking and interviews and assessments while we try to find a diagnosis that fits me. During this process, I've recognised a pattern in my cycles of \"coping\" and \"breaking down\", and I'm wondering if anyone here can relate.\n\nI start a new uni course, a new job, move to a new city. Things are fine for a few months, I'm on fire, working 7 days a week, hyperfocused on the exciting new project. People think I'm enthusiastic, but in reality I feel I'm unworthy of this position and need to put in ALL the hours just to keep up with my peers -- and feel like I'm constantly failing at it. The stress starts building up, I ramp up my efforts, I start feeling the strain. Sleep goes out the window, I gain or lose an enormous amount of weight, I start crying over every little thing, there is no more time in the day to work any harder than I already am.\n\nEventually I have a breakdown, I am told to take some time off, to step back, to relax. I struggle with the relaxing bit, because I don't really deserve it -- didn't I just spend six months procrastinating and crying over a project instead of completing it? But I do as I'm told, I take a break.\n\nThen I redefine my project, change my job, or move to a new city, I feel like a new woman, and \\*this\\* time I'll get it right. I come in hot again, and within a year or two another breakdown comes and the cycle continues.\n\nOf course, this pattern is common and familiar on a scale of days or weeks, and I too have \"turbo mode\" days or weeks followed by \"human potato\" days/weeks. But on the scale of years, I definitely fall into a deep crisis every couple of years and have to reboot my life, only for it to happen again before long. I'm getting tired of moving and changing things -- and my working in academia is both the cause and the \"enabler\" for this sort of thing.\n\nDoes this pattern make sense to any of you?",

I have been taking Vyvanse and Lexapro (on top of the birth control pill and some vitamins) for several years now. Over the years, I have been able to develop some coping mechanisms for dealing with things like decision fatigue, keeping track of deadlines for undegrad/grad school (even though I would still slip up and turn in assignments late from time to time), and trying to maintain some semblance of a routine. I recently had a lot of changes in my life: I moved in with my neuro typical boyfriend; started a new job as a speech therapist in the schools; and my parents moved out of my childhood home. \n\nNow to the reason why I\u2019m writing this post: My boyfriend and I traveled to Maryland for my cousin\u2019s wedding and he got to talking with this man on our plane who is an Egyptologist (my boyfriend is fascinated with Ancient Egypt). The man surprised us after our flight by giving us this beautiful print of an Egyptian King and his wife surrounded by symbols that meant love/togetherness, etc. I had been holding on to the print for the majority of our trip and I got it out yesterday to show to my parents. I COULD HAVE SWORN I put it back in my things and said to myself \u201cI\u2019ll put it here so I don\u2019t lose it\u201d. Except, we\u2019re at the airport, my boyfriend asked to make sure I had the print, and I cannot figure out where it went. My mom says she \u201csaw it last night. Look through your bag or book, you had it\u201d, but I can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere. I\u2019m freaking out!!! I swear I had things taken care of and my boyfriend just asked me why I \u201cdidn\u2019t put things back after I got them out. Especially if that thing is a nice gift.\u201d I feel freaking terrible. I am going to tear my bags apart to look for this print as soon as I get home. I am so mad and disappointed (and upset) with myself.",

I have been taking Vyvanse and Lexapro (on top of the birth control pill and some vitamins) for several years now. Over the years, I have been able to develop some coping mechanisms for dealing with things like decision fatigue, keeping track of deadlines for undegrad/grad school (even though I would still slip up and turn in assignments late from time to time), and trying to maintain some semblance of a routine. I recently had a lot of changes in my life: I moved in with my neuro typical boyfriend; started a new job as a speech therapist in the schools; and my parents moved out of my childhood home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to the reason why I\u2019m writing this post: My boyfriend and I traveled to Maryland for my cousin\u2019s wedding and he got to talking with this man on our plane who is an Egyptologist (my boyfriend is fascinated with Ancient Egypt). The man surprised us after our flight by giving us this beautiful print of an Egyptian King and his wife surrounded by symbols that meant love/togetherness, etc. I had been holding on to the print for the majority of our trip and I got it out yesterday to show to my parents. I COULD HAVE SWORN I put it back in my things and said to myself \u201cI\u2019ll put it here so I don\u2019t lose it\u201d. Except, we\u2019re at the airport, my boyfriend asked to make sure I had the print, and I cannot figure out where it went. My mom says she \u201csaw it last night. Look through your bag or book, you had it\u201d, but I can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere. I\u2019m freaking out!!! I swear I had things taken care of and my boyfriend just asked me why I \u201cdidn\u2019t put things back after I got them out. Especially if that thing is a nice gift.\u201d I feel freaking terrible. I am going to tear my bags apart to look for this print as soon as I get home. I am so mad and disappointed (and upset) with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I read something about craving carbs/sugar for the feeling of general satiety that is lacking in ADHD brains due to dopamine deficiency and / or endorphine deficiency - does anyone experience this? And does anyone have a solution/idea bedtime snack to satisfy and prevent a binge?  \n\n\nI plan my food carefully. I have a history of bulimia and anorexia, and in the past few years I had started incorporating strength training (x2-3 a week) into my fitness routine, which has helped. But this means I need more protein, and now I can't do without the strength training as it seems to regulate whatever is happening in my mind (I also run once a week, cycle to work 5 days a week (about 45-50 mins). I also meditate every day, and this helps HUGELY with my general functioning and ability to choose which impulses I act on.  \nIdeally I would like to not *have* to do all of these things in order to function - these aren't optional for me, as I can literally not get through the day without a meltdown, being in that confused limbo fugue state, and spiralling MH if I don't keep up to this routine. Obviously that's not ideal (or is that normal?) but that's the situation. I'm also autistic.\n\nI have a meal plan, which I need and have been using since my inpatient days for anorexia, to structure things. The planning for food has gone to shit in the past few weeks. And by that I mean that I have been planning, and sticking to it in the day, and then at night have been bingeing before I go to sleep, even when I'm only a little hungry. I think this comes from several areas:  \n\\- Anxiety about overeating = anxiety &gt; urge to eat &gt; binge  \n\\- Anxiety about not sleeping due to overeating (I obviously also have IBS) = anxiety &gt; urge to eat &gt; binge  \n\\-Having to go back downstairs to turn the heating off because my housemate leaves it on and I can't afford that shit, which is fucking annoying &gt; anxiety &gt; urge to eat &gt; binge  \n\\- Anxiety about going to bed hungry  \n\\- Habit  \n\\- End of the day is apparently the most difficult time to manage impulsivity (along the lines of decision fatigue: [https://jamesclear.com/willpower-decision-fatigue](https://jamesclear.com/willpower-decision-fatigue) ), so I try to arrange everything to deal with this. Although, after re-reading this article, I am not actually doing a lot of what it suggests.  \n\\- My actual life is a bit of a mess, and am struggling to get support in relation to autism and ADHD (I am still in assessment waiting lists and too poor to pay privately)  \n\\- Also last week was taking  *Norethisterone* to induce a period, which I haven't had in a year, possibly PCOS / ED related. But it made me really hot and tearful and also hungry lol\n\nI'm losing morale!\n\nI've taken steps to remove stressors, refocus my energy and attention on the main areas I need to focus on at the moment (Health, Family, Work(Writing)), and am just going to have to let the other things go for now. These might even be too much. But I really cannot let my fitness and nutrition slide, as it's the main thing that keeps me stable.\n\nAny tips, similar struggles / experiences, advice, welcome.",

I\u2019ve had a bit of an epiphany lately and I\u2019m hoping some other folks can relate or have some ideas for me to try.\n\nTLDR:\n\nDoes anyone else pack their schedule full of structured activities (classes, clubs, etc.) in order to avoid decision fatigue on what to do next? If so, what are some strategies that have helped you (1) unravel your obligations and create space in your schedule, and (2) deal with task prioritization more effectively so you don\u2019t feel compelled to fill your free time with external deadlines and obligations?\n\nSome details:\n\nOne of my biggest ADHD issues is decision fatigue/paralysis and \u201cnot knowing where to start\u201d when I have too many possibilities in front of me with no clear priority order. I\u2019ve realized lately that this is why I pack my \u201cfree time\u201d full of structured activities, such as joining clubs, volunteering, taking classes/going back to school, having a second job, etc.\n\nI enjoy all of these things individually, and having external obligations takes the \u201cguess work\u201d out of what to do next, which allows me to avoid the decision fatigue. But I\u2019ve reached a point where my schedule feels so tightly packed that there\u2019s no time to relax or enjoy unstructured things like reading a book or gardening, and there\u2019s very little wiggle-room for things to go not-as-planned.\n\nI have a planner that I use regularly, but it\u2019s more of a straight-up calendar for tracking daily, weekly, and monthly activities rather than for longer-term planning. I\u2019ve tried the Getting Things Done approach and this was helpful for a while, but it also became overwhelming very quickly because I had so many things to Get Done. And I tried a Bullet Journal, but it felt too chaotic with random things spread all over the place. I\u2019ve used one at work for years and it\u2019s been great, but my job is a much smaller and more limited universe than my personal life lol.\n\nSome quick context on me: I\u2019m in my early 40s, DX\u2019d and RX\u2019d for about 10 years now. I have most day-to-day things under control pretty well, but I\u2019ve been working through some CBT exercises to so I can handle the \u201cbig things\u201d more effectively and with less stress, and the compulsion to avoid decision fatigue seems to be at the root of a lot of my challenges.\n\nThank you! \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f",

You expend a little more mental energy every time you have to make a decision, it's finite, this is why it gets harder to make good choices as the day goes on. I suspect this is even tougher for anyone with executive dysfunction, because every time you're trying to make a decision or take action, you're basically arguing with a neurological donkey.\n\nI decided to switch to a uniform for work days. I still want to look put together on video calls, but even with meds, getting started on my day is the hardest. I figured this is one way to remove friction.\n\nSo I switched to black turtleneck + leggings + long black cardigan for when it gets cold + black sneakers or slippers. I have loads of great earrings, but usually just default to gold hoops. Let me tell you, it has actually made a difference. Having just ONE less thing to think about in the morning makes the transition to work mode easier.\n\nI think having the same outfit for work also just signals work mode to my brain as soon as I see it, like Pavlovian training. And it's helping me develop and maintain a mental routine, which is so hard for us! A coworker even asked \"how do you always look so put together?\"\n\nIt's so cool to have automated just this one thing. I have 5 identical turtlenecks and 2 pairs of work leggings to rotate through the 5 days. Anyway, it's not a huge thing, I have realized most people don't notice or care about what you wear (as long as you look work appropriate), and it's given me the relief of one useful mental shortcut for days when I can use the extra help.\n\nHope this helps someone!\n\nEdit: I've been doing this 3 weeks now, in case anyone was wondering. It also helps curbs the impulse to buy more clothes for work.",

You expend a little more mental energy every time you have to make a decision, it&amp;#39;s finite, this is why it gets harder to make good choices as the day goes on. I suspect this is even tougher for anyone with executive dysfunction, because every time you&amp;#39;re trying to make a decision or take action, you&amp;#39;re basically arguing with a neurological donkey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to switch to a uniform for work days. I still want to look put together on video calls, but even with meds, getting started on my day is the hardest. I figured this is one way to remove friction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I switched to black turtleneck + leggings + long black cardigan for when it gets cold + black sneakers or slippers. I have loads of great earrings, but usually just default to gold hoops. Let me tell you, it has actually made a difference. Having just ONE less thing to think about in the morning makes the transition to work mode easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think having the same outfit for work also just signals work mode to my brain as soon as I see it, like Pavlovian training. And it&amp;#39;s helping me develop and maintain a mental routine, which is so hard for us! A coworker even asked &amp;quot;how do you always look so put together?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so cool to have automated just this one thing. I have 5 identical turtlenecks and 2 pairs of work leggings to rotate through the 5 days. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s not a huge thing, I have realized most people don&amp;#39;t notice or care about what you wear (as long as you look work appropriate), and it&amp;#39;s given me the relief of one useful mental shortcut for days when I can use the extra help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve been doing this 3 weeks now, in case anyone was wondering. It also helps curbs the impulse to buy more clothes for work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Up until six weeks ago, I commuted by public transit most days, which meant I got a lot of walking in. \n\nUnfortunately, the logistics of my son's daycare situation made it impossible for my husband to do drop off *and* pick up and actually work for more than 4 hours. He works in construction, so while his boss has been amazingly flexible it wasn't feasible long-term. \n\nEnter my MIL's car, currently staying with us on a long-term loan while she spends the winter in Mexico. We split it up so that my husband drops my son off for 9 AM and then works his reasonably full day, and I leave the house very early and arrive at my office at 6:30 AM, then leave at 2 PM to pickup.\n\nSince we started that routine, my focus has been deteriorating at work and I just can't do anything at all in the evenings. Yesterday I was thinking about it, and I think the combination of less exercise by walking, and 60-90 minutes of driving hypervigilance every day is draining me. Y'know, focus fatigue instead of decision fatigue. I can feel the extra stress in my shoulders and neck (they've been up around my ears every time I check for the last two weeks). \n\nQuestion 1: Does this explanation sound plausible to y'all? Or am I nuts?\n\nQuestion 2: Did anyone else experience something similar when they started driving -- or still do? Do you have any suggestions for mitigation?",

Up until six weeks ago, I commuted by public transit most days, which meant I got a lot of walking in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the logistics of my son&amp;#39;s daycare situation made it impossible for my husband to do drop off &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; pick up and actually work for more than 4 hours. He works in construction, so while his boss has been amazingly flexible it wasn&amp;#39;t feasible long-term. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter my MIL&amp;#39;s car, currently staying with us on a long-term loan while she spends the winter in Mexico. We split it up so that my husband drops my son off for 9 AM and then works his reasonably full day, and I leave the house very early and arrive at my office at 6:30 AM, then leave at 2 PM to pickup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we started that routine, my focus has been deteriorating at work and I just can&amp;#39;t do anything at all in the evenings. Yesterday I was thinking about it, and I think the combination of less exercise by walking, and 60-90 minutes of driving hypervigilance every day is draining me. Y&amp;#39;know, focus fatigue instead of decision fatigue. I can feel the extra stress in my shoulders and neck (they&amp;#39;ve been up around my ears every time I check for the last two weeks). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 1: Does this explanation sound plausible to y&amp;#39;all? Or am I nuts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question 2: Did anyone else experience something similar when they started driving -- or still do? Do you have any suggestions for mitigation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This helped when I was in a really bad place due to pandemic woes. I\u2019m super habitual with my food so I enjoyed this a lot. Decision fatigue vanquished. Also my meals involved nearly no prep or cook time, 15 minutes max and rarely that much time. \n\nOn meds is a new challenge since I\u2019ve gone from zero interest in noms, to disgusted, to even having foods I love taste different! That is waning after a couple months but still food is a struggle. So now once I think of something that interests me to eat I don\u2019t question it. I just go for it. I was just staring in the fridge deciding what to eat, what\u2019s a better idea, does anything sound interesting, then eggs in a basket peaked my interested and I just made it no question. Decision fatigue lessened! \n\nAlso, do any of you actually get to eat a meal or drink a cuppa while still warm? I\u2019m typing this bc I\u2019m excited and watching my eggs and toast get cold -.- Especially since meds, I haven\u2019t had a hot meal. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This helped when I was in a really bad place due to pandemic woes. I\u2019m super habitual with my food so I enjoyed this a lot. Decision fatigue vanquished. Also my meals involved nearly no prep or cook time, 15 minutes max and rarely that much time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On meds is a new challenge since I\u2019ve gone from zero interest in noms, to disgusted, to even having foods I love taste different! That is waning after a couple months but still food is a struggle. So now once I think of something that interests me to eat I don\u2019t question it. I just go for it. I was just staring in the fridge deciding what to eat, what\u2019s a better idea, does anything sound interesting, then eggs in a basket peaked my interested and I just made it no question. Decision fatigue lessened! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, do any of you actually get to eat a meal or drink a cuppa while still warm? I\u2019m typing this bc I\u2019m excited and watching my eggs and toast get cold -.- Especially since meds, I haven\u2019t had a hot meal. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hi hi fellow internet strangers here is my question to you: What do you find triggers your ADHD to be bad/worse/better than another day or time in your life?\n\nMy quick backstory: I am 30yo and recently (like many) have realized via tiktok that I have ADHD. Told my mom a few weeks ago when I was considering going for a diagnosis, only to be told that she already had me tested in middle school and I do have it. I vaguely remember her telling me this, but thanks to \\*object impermanence\\* and a \\*shitty memory\\* I forgot about it, and she had never brought it back up.\n\nSo I am looking back over the last 20-ish years and one thing is glaringly obvious to me: my symptoms have changed, come and gone in waves/periods/episodes and fluctuated massively in degree throughout my life. For instance: there have been periods where my depression has been through the roof, but my attention/focus/calm have been \\*chef's kiss\\*. The other side of this coin is when I reflect on times in my life where I have been engaging in a lot of hobbies, been overall active and happy but my impulsivity, attention and focus are through the roof. Some of these \"episodes\" can last months, years, etc. That's not to say there aren't bad days or weeks, but that the trend overall is consistent.\n\nThere are so many layers to this onion I can't even begin to peel them all back in one post. To quickly touch on a few so you can see the places I am mentally traversing in this reflective deep dive: **diet** (I have been my calmest and most focused on high animal fat/keto/low sugar/low coffee/low booze diets, been my worse when I have had a high bread/wheat carb/sugar/alcohol diets) **Supplements** (when I was taking rhodiola, maca, ashwaganda and other thyroid/adrenal supportive herbs and supplements I was clear, calm, focused. I should also mention I was taking multi daily's, getting caffeine from green tea, drinking sleepy time/chamomile tea literally all day and no coffee) **hormones** (I can not focus on certain weeks in my cycle, but another week I feel cracked out) **activities/hobbies** (I have felt mentally the happiest when I am engaged in a continue education program, found a new hobby, am exercising regularly, etc) **stress** (can be situational, environmental, being over stimulated, overwhelmed, etc.. )\n\nI would consider myself a high preforming ADHD-er, I manage a lot of people, money and projects at work. Overall, I have learned how to get ahead of my executive disfunction and know how to use my hyper-focus powers to propel me forward in life. That said, I am going through a major symptomatic episode. I can't remember experiencing anything this horrible since I was in school as a child. I can't focus, I keep interrupting people, no memory, decision fatigue... I could go on. I might just need a vacation but I do think there are some diet and environmental triggers at play here that I haven't cracked the code of yet. Wondering who else out there has been looking at their ADHD in this homeopathic way and what you've found to be true for you?",

I\u2019ve been looking for it for about an hour, it\u2019s just gone. So now I can choose to stay home, but then I probably won\u2019t get much work done.
