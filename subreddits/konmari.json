The first time I did it I ended up getting rid of a lot of stuff that I regretted (clothes and books I probably should have saved for the sentimental category), had a breakdown over it and gave up lol.\n\nI kept trying over the years but always got bogged down in clothes and would give up.\n\nThis time I decided that clothes were fine for now (letting go of perfectionism!!), after getting rid of a lot over the past couple years. I FINALLY moved on to books.\n\nBooks were scary because I was afraid to make the same mistake as last time, but it ended up being a breeze. I had accumulated a lot of books that I didn't ultimately care about (random finds at goodwill, etc) so it was easy to pare down everything. I also realized that owning/collecting books carry less importance to me now than when I was younger. I mean I still love books but I'm less about quantity now and more about quality. I really was holding on to my past self without fully realizing it wasn't me anymore. I even had my first magical moment when I finished going through all the books on my bookshelf in my bedroom and the ones left all fit perfectly on two shelves rather than overflowing!\n\nNow I'm on papers. I just realized I've been on papers for about a week now. I'm doing pretty well but I'm getting bogged down with magazines and what I should keep or not. I'm getting a lot of decision fatigue. Not to mention all the emotions that come up while doing all of this. I've been looking through papers I haven't touched in years.\n\nToday I fantasized about just calling 1-800 JUNK and having them haul out the entire apt, lol.\n\nI'm so tired of all of this stuff, and I'm disappointed in myself for neglecting so many of my possessions and letting them collect dust and in some cases mold and carpet beetles (that helped with discarding a lot quickly though...ugh.). Because of the mold and carpet beetle issue I sometimes just feel like everything is contaminated (even though it's been gone and haven't had any issues since I first discovered it 2 years ago). I don't want to live with this feeling! And to be clear I live in a generally clean apartment, just left unchecked, dust and mold can accumulate quickly. And unfortunately it did in some neglected and hidden corners of the apt.\n\nI used to be better about taking care of my stuff. I used to love a lot of what I owned more. What happened? Life, grief, mental health struggles, phone addiction, etc. General overwhelm. I'm trying to be kind to myself.\n\nBut I've reached my breaking point. Big changes need to happen now. For one thing, I'm probably going to move within the next year and I do not want to lug a lot of this stuff with me. The second thing is, I lost my dad last year and life is way too short to be bogged down by this clutter. I'm so done. I want to truly focus on what gives me joy in life not what I think 'should' give me joy or what 'might' give me joy, but what gives me joy now.",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my second tidying festival. The first time I did it I ended up getting rid of a lot of stuff that I regretted (clothes and books I probably should have saved for the sentimental category), had a breakdown over it and gave up lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept trying over the years but always got bogged down in clothes and would give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time I decided that clothes were fine for now (letting go of perfectionism!!), after getting rid of a lot over the past couple years. I FINALLY moved on to books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Books were scary because I was afraid to make the same mistake as last time, but it ended up being a breeze. I had accumulated a lot of books that I didn&amp;#39;t ultimately care about (random finds at goodwill, etc) so it was easy to pare down everything. I also realized that owning/collecting books carry less importance to me now than when I was younger. I mean I still love books but I&amp;#39;m less about quantity now and more about quality. I really was holding on to my past self without fully realizing it wasn&amp;#39;t me anymore. I even had my first magical moment when I finished going through all the books on my bookshelf in my bedroom and the ones left all fit perfectly on two shelves rather than overflowing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m on papers. I just realized I&amp;#39;ve been on papers for about a week now. I&amp;#39;m doing pretty well but I&amp;#39;m getting bogged down with magazines and what I should keep or not. I&amp;#39;m getting a lot of decision fatigue. Not to mention all the emotions that come up while doing all of this. I&amp;#39;ve been looking through papers I haven&amp;#39;t touched in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I fantasized about just calling 1-800 JUNK and having them haul out the entire apt, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of all of this stuff, and I&amp;#39;m disappointed in myself for neglecting so many of my possessions and letting them collect dust and in some cases mold and carpet beetles (that helped with discarding a lot quickly though...ugh.). Because of the mold and carpet beetle issue I sometimes just feel like everything is contaminated (even though it&amp;#39;s been gone and haven&amp;#39;t had any issues since I first discovered it 2 years ago). I don&amp;#39;t want to live with this feeling! And to be clear I live in a generally clean apartment, just left unchecked, dust and mold can accumulate quickly. And unfortunately it did in some neglected and hidden corners of the apt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to be better about taking care of my stuff. I used to love a lot of what I owned more. What happened? Life, grief, mental health struggles, phone addiction, etc. General overwhelm. I&amp;#39;m trying to be kind to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve reached my breaking point. Big changes need to happen now. For one thing, I&amp;#39;m probably going to move within the next year and I do not want to lug a lot of this stuff with me. The second thing is, I lost my dad last year and life is way too short to be bogged down by this clutter. I&amp;#39;m so done. I want to truly focus on what gives me joy in life not what I think &amp;#39;should&amp;#39; give me joy or what &amp;#39;might&amp;#39; give me joy, but what gives me joy now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019m not quite finished yet but wanted to share an update for anyone considering starting or already in the process!\n\nI have unmedicated ADHD, have this summer off work, and the way I grew up makes it tough for me to get rid of things. I\u2019m a thrifter, v sentimental, and hold on to lots of things \u201cin case I need them.\u201d I\u2019m a maximalist in terms of wardrobe and party hosting, love makeup and skincare, have lots of incomplete crafts/abandoned hobbies. So basically I have poor executive function skills, almost unlimited time for this project (deadline is when I go back to work to teach or baby arrives) and a LOT OF JUNK. Never been a tidy person, and had no belief in myself at the start of this but was hell bent on trying it as a final Hail Mary to get our home in order.\n\nIt\u2019s been a month, but all told I\u2019ve put roughly 45 hours into tidying. As the nesting has gotten more intense, I\u2019ve gone from doing 1-3 hours of tidying a day for 1-2 days in a row to doing 4-8 hours a day for 2-3 days in a row. So far, I have discarded 5 hatchback car loads of items. I still have the kitchen, books, and about 1/2 the garage left to do. Since starting, I have gone to bed almost every night (save a few pregnancy induced exhaustion episodes) with a perfectly tidy home and I feel like a new person. I believe in myself in ways I never have before.\n\nHOW I STAYED FAITHFUL TO MARIE\u2019S TIPS\n\n-Taking everything out in a category from multiple locations and piling together is essential. It\u2019s not just the overwhelming sight of how much you have; it\u2019s the nature of batch work as well as setting up for successful storage and future tidying. ADHD has taught me that batching similar tasks together improves productivity as well as decreasing decision fatigue that happens in the middle of transitions from one kind of task to the next. By doing all the things in one category at once, you grease the wheels and will have easier progress even though sometimes it\u2019s difficult to determine what does or doesn\u2019t spark joy. Additionally, once you have everything left over that you\u2019re going to keep in one area, you immediately know how much storage you\u2019ll actually need for the space which then makes it a really smooth process to store everything in a way that makes sense and sets you up for an easier time as you maintain your organization. It works best if you have a specific designated area that\u2019s not the bed you sleep in or someone else is space to do this in so if you only have one hour to make progress, you can still leave the pile there and get back to it the next day. \n\n-Decoding what sparks joy is difficult and reading the second book really helps. I kept repeating to myself that things that spark joy feel like holding a puppy. For useful but less joyful things, I thought about how much relief I might feel actually having something like a toilet brush or a pair of needle nose pliers close at hand when I needed them, or alternatively how frustrating it would be to not have that item when I needed it.\n\n-I started with clothing. It was very difficult because I love clothing, and a few times I wanted to stop and move to a different, easier category. However, getting the clothing done first made a HUGE difference in how my home feels, how I live in my home on a daily basis, and was also a GIANT confidence boost that paved the way for the rest of my successes. \n\n-Thanking each thing as I discarded also made it easier, as I focused on my gratitude for the item and how it might serve someone else even better than it served me and, in most cases, the one(s) who owned it before me since most of my stuff is thrifted. I also kept in mind her second book tips about how sometimes receiving/buying an item is the whole item\u2019s purpose for you, and that item isn\u2019t necessarily intended to be owned and used by you forever. Items can also fulfill their purpose in our lives by teaching us what we don\u2019t love or need. I\u2019m Christian and didn\u2019t grow up experiencing Eastern mysticism, so the way Marie sometimes interacts with things seems almost a casual form of idolatry but it has helped me learn new ways of living life with an open hand\u2026. Not to hold onto things too tightly, because I believe that nothing is truly mine in a spiritual sense. This has made the act of discarding things a grateful process that is just as joyful as deciding what joy-sparking things to keep.\n\n-I haven\u2019t asked my husband to be part of this process aside from lifting/moving stuff I can\u2019t wrangle myself. I haven\u2019t asked him to discard anything EXCEPT for things that are shared, or things that have been unearthed and are now kept in limited storage areas (the tub of cords, which I wouldn\u2019t know what needs to be kept, and his coats in our tiny coat closet that had been stored in the garage.) in these cases I just say \u201cwill you make sure you want to keep all these things so I don\u2019t buy storage containers that are bigger than we need?\u201d \n\nWAYS I HAVE STRAYED FROM MARIE\u2019S TIPS\n\n-I went from clothing to my bathroom category to improve my daily quality of life more. I really had no space to get ready in there because the items for personal care drastically outmatched storage space. It was at this point that I sort of moved away from doing everything in one category and kind of transitioned to tidying from room to room. It was also at this point in watching the Netflix series and reading people\u2019s posts in the sub Reddit that I realized I wasn\u2019t as horribly untidy as I had always believed myself to be. Everything in the personal care category was already in my bathroom, all of my crafts already were in the craft closet, all of my China was in the China cabinet and so on. I just had too much stuff that was poorly organized and underutilized. This meant that for the most part I could safely move from room to room doing one category at a time, I just had to do a quick sweep of the garage and rest of the house to make sure everything from each category was safely in that room. anything that wasn\u2019t already safely in that room was likely stored in a random junk drawer, either in the garage, kitchen, or guest bedroom dresser.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n-I don\u2019t fold most of my fabric items, though Marie does. Our built in storage space is predominantly hanging, and I\u2019ve gotten in the habit of hanging almost everything. I wonder if most storage in other countries is based on drawers? My husband and I installed new bracket shelves and I purchased clear open front stackable boxes for undergarments, and I have an old three drawer dresser for leggings/bike shorts/golf skirts. Everything else including pj tops/tshirts gets hung which I quite like. My husbands plain black work tshirts do get folded, as do most of his work jeans and workout/PJ bottoms but that\u2019s a system I don\u2019t interfere with :)\n\n-Using square storage, including small boxes in drawers, is life changing and space saving. Her methods of folding and storing things upright instead of stacked are also amazing and way easier to manage than I thought they would be.",

It\u2019s not just the overwhelming sight of how much you have; it\u2019s the nature of batch work as well as setting up for successful storage and future tidying. ADHD has taught me that batching similar tasks together improves productivity as well as decreasing decision fatigue that happens in the middle of transitions from one kind of task to the next. By doing all the things in one category at once, you grease the wheels and will have easier progress even though sometimes it\u2019s difficult to determine what does or doesn\u2019t spark joy. Additionally, once you have everything left over that you\u2019re going to keep in one area, you immediately know how much storage you\u2019ll actually need for the space which then makes it a really smooth process to store everything in a way that makes sense and sets you up for an easier time as you maintain your organization. It works best if you have a specific designated area that\u2019s not the bed you sleep in or someone else is space to do this in so if you only have one hour to make progress, you can still leave the pile there and get back to it the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Decoding what sparks joy is difficult and reading the second book really helps. I kept repeating to myself that things that spark joy feel like holding a puppy. For useful but less joyful things, I thought about how much relief I might feel actually having something like a toilet brush or a pair of needle nose pliers close at hand when I needed them, or alternatively how frustrating it would be to not have that item when I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I started with clothing. It was very difficult because I love clothing, and a few times I wanted to stop and move to a different, easier category. However, getting the clothing done first made a HUGE difference in how my home feels, how I live in my home on a daily basis, and was also a GIANT confidence boost that paved the way for the rest of my successes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Thanking each thing as I discarded also made it easier, as I focused on my gratitude for the item and how it might serve someone else even better than it served me and, in most cases, the one(s) who owned it before me since most of my stuff is thrifted. I also kept in mind her second book tips about how sometimes receiving/buying an item is the whole item\u2019s purpose for you, and that item isn\u2019t necessarily intended to be owned and used by you forever. Items can also fulfill their purpose in our lives by teaching us what we don\u2019t love or need. I\u2019m Christian and didn\u2019t grow up experiencing Eastern mysticism, so the way Marie sometimes interacts with things seems almost a casual form of idolatry but it has helped me learn new ways of living life with an open hand\u2026. Not to hold onto things too tightly, because I believe that nothing is truly mine in a spiritual sense. This has made the act of discarding things a grateful process that is just as joyful as deciding what joy-sparking things to keep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I haven\u2019t asked my husband to be part of this process aside from lifting/moving stuff I can\u2019t wrangle myself. I haven\u2019t asked him to discard anything EXCEPT for things that are shared, or things that have been unearthed and are now kept in limited storage areas (the tub of cords, which I wouldn\u2019t know what needs to be kept, and his coats in our tiny coat closet that had been stored in the garage.) in these cases I just say \u201cwill you make sure you want to keep all these things so I don\u2019t buy storage containers that are bigger than we need?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WAYS I HAVE STRAYED FROM MARIE\u2019S TIPS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I went from clothing to my bathroom category to improve my daily quality of life more. I really had no space to get ready in there because the items for personal care drastically outmatched storage space. It was at this point that I sort of moved away from doing everything in one category and kind of transitioned to tidying from room to room. It was also at this point in watching the Netflix series and reading people\u2019s posts in the sub Reddit that I realized I wasn\u2019t as horribly untidy as I had always believed myself to be. Everything in the personal care category was already in my bathroom, all of my crafts already were in the craft closet, all of my China was in the China cabinet and so on. I just had too much stuff that was poorly organized and underutilized. This meant that for the most part I could safely move from room to room doing one category at a time, I just had to do a quick sweep of the garage and rest of the house to make sure everything from each category was safely in that room. anything that wasn\u2019t already safely in that room was likely stored in a random junk drawer, either in the garage, kitchen, or guest bedroom dresser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I don\u2019t fold most of my fabric items, though Marie does. Our built in storage space is predominantly hanging, and I\u2019ve gotten in the habit of hanging almost everything. I wonder if most storage in other countries is based on drawers? My husband and I installed new bracket shelves and I purchased clear open front stackable boxes for undergarments, and I have an old three drawer dresser for leggings/bike shorts/golf skirts. Everything else including pj tops/tshirts gets hung which I quite like. My husbands plain black work tshirts do get folded, as do most of his work jeans and workout/PJ bottoms but that\u2019s a system I don\u2019t interfere with :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Using square storage, including small boxes in drawers, is life changing and space saving. Her methods of folding and storing things upright instead of stacked are also amazing and way easier to manage than I thought they would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I got rid of a lot of stuff that I realized I was hanging on to because I thought I should be a person who had those things (I'm not going to read Les Miserable, I've tried, I can't) and really focused on the stuff that made me happy. I ended up getting rid of probably a third of my things. Some of the time it was hard because I thought it was worth money so hung on to it. Then realizing that the $100 I thought I could get for something wasn't worth the stress of trying to sell it, particularly since that $100 wasn't happening. \n\nI've done smaller purges in the two years. Nothing major, but I change so what makes me happy changes. Old things have served their purpose and I can let them go and some new things have come into my life.\n\nI recently rearranged my whole apartment. I realized I was just getting upset with how things were. My dresser is now in my living room. Why? Because it makes me happy. It is pretty and blue and I live by myself so why not? With a bit of reorg half of it is cloths and half of it is my art supplies. I have a bookshelf in my kitchen for the same reason. It makes me happy. I need no other reason than that.\n\nThings I've really taken away from the whole process.\n\n1. Yes it really did change part of my life. Its annoying to say sometimes but it is true!\n2. I was holding on to physical manifestations of guilt/expectations/or persevered short comings. I didn't think it was there but it was background noise seeing those things. Taking them away cleaned up emotional space as well as physical space.\n3. Cleaning is easier. With fewer things everything lives somewhere. Decision fatigue is real and trying to clean while making choices where each thing goes turned out to be a big hurdle for me. I can make the choice once then just put something back. \n4. I love color. 20 year old me wouldn't have believed that but my life is full of it. My desire to simplify and drawn to minimalism isn't me. I have a wall of crowed art work that I adore. I wear a lot more color.\n5. It isn't a one and done sort of thing. Regularly checking in with whether or not I'm happy with things is good.\n6. Yeah don't do this while depressed, doesn't fix anything, but when my depression kicks in being in a space that past me set up to be one of joy does make life enough more cozy to help.\n7. I don't really remember most of the things I got rid of. Regret over getting rid of something I though would be a lot bigger. \n8. Everything has a place! Seriously this one I can't advocate for enough. If it doesn't have a place in your home why do you have it?\n\nSo everyone who is wondering if it really does work: yes. It really can. My living space is much better now and that makes such a difference in the quality of life.  \n",
