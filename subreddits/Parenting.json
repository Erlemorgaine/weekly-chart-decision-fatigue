My husband is amazing; he's a great father and partner and he's thoughtful and patient and funny and kind. But sometimes he seems to forget that just because I'm with our kid everyday and I don't go into a physical office, I'm not a stay at home mom.\n\nWe're extremely fortunate to have both sets of grandparents within an hour's drive and one of them helps everyday so I can get work done. Some days my son and I drive 40 minutes to my parents', some days my MIL comes to our condo. But the grandparents are in their 70s. So I'm very involved throughout the day giving them breaks, dealing with toddler tantrums, making decisions, changing diapers, planning and cooking meals, begging a toddler to eat, etc. And of course the grandparents have lives of their own, so there's constant rearranging of schedules and changing my working hours to accomodate.\n\nIt's the decision fatigue that's killing me. 3 meals a day with my kid, for 13 months. Endless decisions that balance my work, my kid's needs, and the needs of two grandmothers. Plus prioritizing my work for the limited time I have. Add in decisions based on Covid safety - like whether it's ok for my son to go to the park or play outside with a neighbor or go to the grocery store...\n\nSo when my husband just gets dressed in the morning and walks out the door, leaving me to pick out weather-appropriate kid clothes, figure out breakfast, pack up, etc. Or when he comes home and asks what's for dinner or says he's too tired to put our son down. Well, I just want to scream. I know this is the age old problems of \"mental load\" falling traditionally on the mom. And he and I have discussed it at length. He tries to help. And he does help, a little. But he just... forgets.\n\nAnyone have words of wisdom for me on how to change or just make peace with the situation?",

I'm thinking of telling them they cannot see my son if they don't get it. My brother and his wife are on board for getting vaccinated, but their children can't get vaccinated. My sister in law said her sister will not get vaccinated which means my niece and nephew can get sick from their relatives. I was looking forward to seeing to my brother and sister in law but since they are a link to unvaccinated people, I don't feel comfortable.\n\nSo, even if I get vaccinated, my child can still get sick from any unprotected person. How am I supposed to screen every person I come in contact with? Especially if they have children. It's like, \"yeah that's great that you got vaccinated but I need to know if your children have come in contact with anyone who isn't vaccinated!\".\n\nThis actually feels more complicated than just avoiding everyone like we have been.
