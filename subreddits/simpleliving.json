I rarely know what I will be doing the next hour or the next day.  I have special-needs kids and long-Covid, which makes life rather unpredictable.\n\nI fantasize about what it might be like to live in a prosperous premodern agrarian society (during a good year with no wars, plagues, or huge tragedies).  I like the idea of working and celebrating on a predicable seasonal schedule.\n\nI wonder what decisions I can eliminate to reduce my decision-fatigue? \n\nI have a simple wardrobe, which I love. \n\nI\u2019m on an anti-consumerism kick, so I don\u2019t think much about shopping.\n\nI wonder love to find other ways to simplify housework and family life.\n\nWhat works for you?",

My life in the US feels like a never-ending parade of decisions.  Each decision feels like it costs me a tiny bit of mental energy.  I\u2019m not someone who follows routines naturally.  I rarely know what I will be doing the next hour or the next day.  I have special-needs kids and long-Covid, which makes life rather unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fantasize about what it might be like to live in a prosperous premodern agrarian society (during a good year with no wars, plagues, or huge tragedies).  I like the idea of working and celebrating on a predicable seasonal schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder what decisions I can eliminate to reduce my decision-fatigue? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a simple wardrobe, which I love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m on an anti-consumerism kick, so I don\u2019t think much about shopping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder love to find other ways to simplify housework and family life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What works for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
