Some ideas are: Kamakura day trip or 1 night stay, Hakone one night stay, takayama bc it sounds secluded and peaceful but its out of the way from the rest of my trip. Same thing with Nikko. Another option could be staying in osaka for a couple days since they/we are only maybe taking a day trip from kyoto to visit there, and then exploring the city or taking a day trip to kobe.

Booked this on a last minute whim and so don\u2019t know much more than very basic japanese. Want to budget where I can so I can splurge on nice things like a night or two in a ryokan and nice meals. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Here is my rough itinerary so far:**\r  \n\r  \n**2/25** arrive at 7 pm via haneda airport.

Explore a little bit.\r  \n\r  \n**3/1**  leave for kinosaki onsen and stay the night there at hopefully at least  midtier ryokan\r  \n\r  \n**3/2** go back to kyoto/osaka then do day trip somewhere? Nara? Kobe?\r  \n\r  \n**3/3** meet with friends in kyoto (if i\u2019m not already there) and check in airbnb.

Only set things are Teamlabs and market&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/28&lt;/strong&gt; friends depart to ski in Nagano fairly early. Deciding between day trip to kamakura or hakone/atami/peninsula and if should stay the night in any of these places or go back to tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(unless i forward my luggage to the next place and take shinkansen there?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/29&lt;/strong&gt; leave for kyoto or osaka and stay in cheap hotel or ryokan. Explore a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/1&lt;/strong&gt;  leave for kinosaki onsen and stay the night there at hopefully at least  midtier ryokan&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/2&lt;/strong&gt; go back to kyoto/osaka then do day trip somewhere? Nara? Kobe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/3&lt;/strong&gt; meet with friends in kyoto (if i\u2019m not already there) and check in airbnb. Explore the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/4-3/5&lt;/strong&gt; keep exploring kyoto and maybe take a day trip to osaka or nara. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/6&lt;/strong&gt;  Go back with friends to tokyo. They fly out and I stay for one more night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/7&lt;/strong&gt; Fly out in the evening, around 9 pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you if you\u2019ve made it this far and for any helpful advice you can give. Please advice on if a  JR pass would be worth it also. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
