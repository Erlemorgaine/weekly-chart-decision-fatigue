I have ADHD but do not struggle much with executive dysfunction. I have really mastered the \"if it only takes 30 seconds to put it away just walk all the way to do that\" or \"if it takes 2 minutes to clean just do it\" sort of mindsets. Even if I'm struggling with functioning I still tend to tidy up my own spaces about once a week to once every other week.\n\nMy partner also has ADHD but struggles MAJORLY with executive dysfunction. They also have horrible object permanence so they are constantly surrounded by things because they either won't put them away because it's too much effort or they wont put them away because they will forget it exists if they do. On top of this they also have high decision fatigue.   \n\n\nBecause of all of this I have accepted that the house will never be clean all the time and there will always be SOME level of clutter. What is important to me is that the space feels *open*. I'm not as fussed about it being spotless.  \n\n\nWe made a goal this year that I want to have the house clean for every sabbat (pagan holidays. there are 8 spaced equally through the year). A few years ago we cleaned the house to celebrate Ostara and we both LOVED how it felt. My partner is completely on board with this goal.\n\nWhen I get overwhelmed by clutter that isn't mine things build up way worse than I'm willing to admit, and my partner rarely has the motivation to clean their stuff. So as a result we currently just clean the house to a baseline about twice a year.  \n\n\nSo this week is Imbolc so I have been working on getting the house cleaned.  Whenever the tidying involves my partners things I have them come over to help and I will hand them stuff which they will just collect in their hands. When I ask what they plan to do with it they just say \"I'm just going to put it somewhere else\" which has been driving me CRAZY. I want there to be designated spots for everything but inevitably it will all end up on top of the already existing pile of \"stuff to figure out what to do with\" that is sitting on top of our dog's crate or on top of my bookshelf or in the giant pile next to the laundry room or... you get the idea.  \n\n\nHow can I help them declutter while navigating the decision fatigue and also acknowledging that my partner ISN'T a minimalist? I don't care how much stuff they have I just want it put somewhere in an organized way and not in piles in various places around the house never to be looked at again. Like I said it's important to me that spaces feel open. I want light to be able to shine through areas. I want to feel like I can move in a space. But all these piles of miscellaneous objects are making me feel heavy.  \n\n\nAny advice?  \n\n\nTLDR my partner's way of helping me declutter is just to \"put it somewhere else\" which inevitably leads to random piles of miscellaneous objects around the house. How do I get them to decide on a place?",

Is there a thought process that helps you to not get overwhelmed when you need to complete a task? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure if this pertains, but I do deal with ADD and \u2018perfectionism\u2019, which I think causes me to overthink to a crippling degree, at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We are saving $100 a month  \n  \nFor context, I downsized from 2000 sq ft with a 2 car garage to 1030sq ft. The next size down is 5x5 so this will be my next goal.\n\nI started with the non-sentimental items.   \nI had put a bunch of household items, clothes and shoes aside in storage bags and said if I didn't use them in 6 months I'd donate them.   \n  \nHere's what is left:  \n1. Holiday decorations- the gamut of Halloween-Christmas (which I can thin out when the thrift store accepts those items, they are VERY picky about when you can bring these items). I have a giant Balsam Hill Christmas tree that won't fit anywhere in our new place that I will try to sell locally.  \n  \n2. Artwork- I have a large art collection and very limited wall space. I had already gotten rid of a LOT of it before I moved but I am still very attached to these remaining pieces. I bought new artwork for my new place from local artists so any decent wall space is used and I feel like the old pieces will look out of place.  \n  \n3. 2-4 large bins of childhood \"memories, of yearbooks, newspaper articles, photos and wedding day trinkets. I had downsized this a bit already, but got decision fatigue/stressed so I stopped.  \n  \n4. Grandma's china from mine and my husband's, and two small antique tables and other items that I have no room/use for, and does not suit my style. My mother is a HUGE guilt tripper, she will constantly ask me where stuff is and if I still have it. She does not want it and I am not burdening my children with any of this.  \n  \n5. Empty boxes for our expensive stereo components. These are like emotional support items for my husband but take up a lot of room. At least he got rid of all of the Playstation/Apple boxes. As long as we have a storage unit I guess they can stay for now until we are able to downsize once again and those items make it impossible to do so.  \n  \n6. My wedding dress. My daughter (28) married 7 years now, and chose her own dress to wear. Why am I keeping this? I have two sons and the prospect of their future brides wanting is zero.  \n\n\nThe sentimental items is giving me guilt and I am worried I won't be able to do it without feeling terrible.",

We are saving $100 a month  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, I downsized from 2000 sq ft with a 2 car garage to 1030sq ft. The next size down is 5x5 so this will be my next goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started with the non-sentimental items.&lt;br/&gt;\nI had put a bunch of household items, clothes and shoes aside in storage bags and said if I didn&amp;#39;t use them in 6 months I&amp;#39;d donate them.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what is left:&lt;br/&gt;\n1. Holiday decorations- the gamut of Halloween-Christmas (which I can thin out when the thrift store accepts those items, they are VERY picky about when you can bring these items). I have a giant Balsam Hill Christmas tree that won&amp;#39;t fit anywhere in our new place that I will try to sell locally.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artwork- I have a large art collection and very limited wall space. I had already gotten rid of a LOT of it before I moved but I am still very attached to these remaining pieces. I bought new artwork for my new place from local artists so any decent wall space is used and I feel like the old pieces will look out of place.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-4 large bins of childhood &amp;quot;memories, of yearbooks, newspaper articles, photos and wedding day trinkets. I had downsized this a bit already, but got decision fatigue/stressed so I stopped.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grandma&amp;#39;s china from mine and my husband&amp;#39;s, and two small antique tables and other items that I have no room/use for, and does not suit my style. My mother is a HUGE guilt tripper, she will constantly ask me where stuff is and if I still have it. She does not want it and I am not burdening my children with any of this.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empty boxes for our expensive stereo components. These are like emotional support items for my husband but take up a lot of room. At least he got rid of all of the Playstation/Apple boxes. As long as we have a storage unit I guess they can stay for now until we are able to downsize once again and those items make it impossible to do so.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wedding dress. My daughter (28) married 7 years now, and chose her own dress to wear. Why am I keeping this? I have two sons and the prospect of their future brides wanting is zero.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sentimental items is giving me guilt and I am worried I won&amp;#39;t be able to do it without feeling terrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There's no way to easily summarize it.\n\nI'm active in a lot of decluttering and minimalism groups on Reddit and Facebook, and I frequently see people post about struggling with minimizing clothing.  I often respond to these posts with my experience and methods for decluttering, which I've been told numerous times is helpful, so I thought I'd post it here for anyone struggling with this area.  It's pretty in depth, and goes into more than just the decluttering aspect.\n\nI've had a TON of clothes since I was a teenager, and always had the hardest time getting rid of things.  I never felt comfortable in my skin and always had a hard time finding clothes that I felt looked good on me, partially because of body image issues, and partially because things never seemed to fit me right.  I'm a perfectly average 5'6\" female, but I found that shirts were always really short and showed my belly (which I was self-conscious about) and pants were always really long and dragged on the floor.  It wasn't until I was in my mid-30s that I finally started to understand WHY clothes never fit me properly, because I happened upon an article that talked about body proportions.\n\n**Figure Out What Actually Fits You**\n\nSo, apparently most off-the-rack clothing is designed to fit the \"average\" person who has generally equal body proportions; that is, their inseam (crotch to floor) length is approximately the same as their torso (crotch to top of head) length.  So, for my very average height of 5'6\", or 66 inches, my inseam length should be about 33\" and my torso (crotch to crown) length should also be about 33\".  However, when I actually measured, my inseam is 30\" and my torso is 36\".  I essentially have the legs of someone who is 5 feet tall and the torso of someone who is 6 feet tall.  My 5 foot tall best friend gave me some jeans that no longer fit her, and they fit me perfectly, even though I am 6 inches taller than her (my mother still doesn't understand how this works).  \n\nBecause my top and bottom halves are disproportionate in length, I now buy my shirts in the tall section and my pants in the petite section.  This alone, even before I further honed in what my actual style is, made a HUGE difference in how I looked and felt in clothes, because they actually FIT me properly for the first time.  I trucked along for several years with finally having properly fitting clothes, but still having way too many and not wearing the vast majority of them, before I really embraced trying to declutter and lead a more minimalist lifestyle (we've moved across the country a lot, and to be honest, I just got tired of hauling shit across the country every few years).\n\nMy husband is 5'10\" and actually has similar proportions as me (long torso and short legs) and while men's pants usually have inseams as part of their sizing, we have found that even though he is not particularly \"tall,\" he also has to buy his shirts from the men's tall section (which can be difficult to find because he is very slender, and often times the men's tall sizes are only available in \"big and tall.\").  So my above advice on body measurements can be just as applicable to men as it is to women.\n\n**Making a Capsule Wardrobe**\n\nA few years ago, I discovered the concept of a capsule wardrobe.  Essentially, a capsule wardrobe is a curated closet of items that all go together.  You can mix and match and layer and grab any random item, or even get dressed in the dark, and still look put together.  I have ADHD and get decision fatigue easily, so I thought this would be a good way to start paring down my wardrobe and minimizing the number of decisions I have to make in a day to give my poor brain a break.  Also, visual clutter stresses me out, so I was trying to minimize that, as well.\n\nThe basic steps of making a capsule wardrobe are: pick your base color; pick your coordinating neutrals; pick your accent color; add a few patterns and layers; and add shoes and accessories.  There are a ton of websites out there that talk about capsule wardrobes, but the one I prefer is called Classy Yet Trendy, and her method is the one I loosely follow (I'm not affiliated with her or anything, I just like her method).  Here's the link to her capsule wardrobe intro guide if people want more info:  [https://classyyettrendy.com/2017/02/start-capsule-wardrobe-5-steps.html/](https://classyyettrendy.com/2017/02/start-capsule-wardrobe-5-steps.html/)\n\nStep 1: Start with your base color\n\nSo, I initially started out my capsule wardrobe with a base color of black, because that was what I mostly had in my closet.  So I got rid of everything that was navy.  But after wearing that for about 6-12 months, I realized black really washed me out and that navy actually complemented my skin tone better, so I had to overhaul my entire wardrobe.  So, don't make my mistake.  \n\nTry on a black shirt, and try on a navy shirt (edit: you could also use brown or grey as a base; it\u2019s totally up to you). Decide which one you think you look better in.  Which color makes you look healthier, more vibrant?  Maybe even take a picture and compare the pictures side by side.  Do you feel better and more like yourself in one color or the other?  Or are you someone who could look equally good in either color (ie you have a neutral skin tone)? You may need someone to help you with this if you truly can't decide which one looks better.\n\nOther than the two shirts that you are trying on to determine your base color, DO NOT TRY ON ANY CLOTHES at this point.\n\nOnce you've picked your base color (I'm going to use navy in my examples, since that's my base) get rid of EVERYTHING in your closet that is black.  If you are really, REALLY not sure what you want your base color to be, box up everything black and put it in storage for now, and just work with what's left.  Hopefully, just by removing everything that is not your base color, your wardrobe is already pared down quite significantly for the next steps.\n\nStep 2: Pick your coordinating neutrals\n\nCoordinating neutrals are things like ivory, cream, white, tan, and brown. (Edit: grey can also be a coordinating neutral if it\u2019s not your base).  I have shades of all of these as my neutrals in my capsule, and I also use chambray as a neutral.  You may not pull anything out at this stage, and that is totally okay. Edit: Ideally you should have like 2-3 coordinating neutrals. \n\nYou are STILL NOT TRYING ANYTHING ON.\n\nStep 3: Pick your accent color.\n\nAt this point, you are deciding what non-base, non-neutral color you look and feel the best in.  You may need to start with color tones, such as jewel tones versus pastels.  Put on a plain white shirt, and start holding clothes up in front of you and looking in the mirror (DO NOT TRY ANYTHING ON).  I figured out that I personally do NOT look good in pastels, but I DO look good in jewel tones.  So everything pastel was automatically put into the discard pile, and I was left with jewel tones.  If you look equally good in both, start instead with the next paragraph.\n\nOnce you've figured out what tone looks best, now you are going to figure out what color you feel the best in.  Are there specific colors that make you feel good whenever you wear them, or that you gravitate towards the most?  Do you get a ton of compliments when you wear a certain color?  For me, that color is bright royal blue.  So of all of the shirts I have left, I only kept the ones that were royal blue, or had royal blue in the pattern.\n\nYou are STILL NOT TRYING ANYTHING ON.\n\nStep 4: Pick patterns\n\nAt this point, I had so few clothes left that I only had a few patterns, so I just stuck with what I had.  But if you still have a ton of clothes left, pick like 3 or 4 patterns (stripes, polka dots, plaid, etc) to accent your wardrobe.\n\nYou are STILL NOT TRYING ANYTHING ON in this step.\n\nStep 5: Add in shoes and accessories.\n\nWith a base color of navy, get rid of any shoes that are black.  Or vice versa if your base is black.  I'm not going to go into minimizing accessories.\n\n**Post-capsule Minimizing**\n\nSo, now you are left with the makings of a capsule wardrobe.  Only now are you actually going to start trying things on.  Try on everything that is left.  Do those pants kind of sit at a funny height, giving you a muffin top?  Is that shirt a little too snug and you have to constantly adjust it to make it sit right?  Does that shirt fit, but maybe it's just not your style?  Get rid of them.  Be ruthless.  If you don't look good or feel good in an item of clothing, it is not serving its purpose, and you shouldn't allow it to waste your valuable space and time.  Your clothing should make you feel good and confident.\n\nGoing back to measurements and style, I found that because of my weird body proportions, and because I have to buy petite pants, I can only buy pants that are high rise, because otherwise they are too low cut and I'm showing off things that nobody needs to see.  If you have a short torso and long legs, you might find the opposite, that you need tall pants but in a low or mid rise unless you want your waistband up to your neck.  I also found that because of my job (in a healthcare office setting) I need the majority of my clothes to be business casual, and I like a French minimalist style, so I tend to wear pants, a blouse, and a cardigan on most days, even my weekends because that's what I'm comfortable in.  I hate shorts, so I own no shorts other than two pairs of workout shorts.  A capsule wardrobe is not a one-size-fits-all approach; you can customize it to be whatever you want.  If you love pattern and color, by all means, pick several accent colors and patterns.\n\nYou might be alarmed at this point how little you have left.  What are you going to wear if you get rid of things in colors that don't suit you, or styles that don't fit you?  Well, you're going to wear things that look good on you and that make you feel good.  And maybe your wardrobe is going to be a little sparse for a while, and that's okay.  You might find that you get by perfectly fine with a sparse wardrobe.  Maybe the things you have left are the only things that you were wearing anyway, because most people are going to reach for the things that make them look and feel good.  I have no idea how true that saying of \"you wear 20% of your clothing 80% of the time\" is, but I would guess it's probably pretty accurate.  You very well might just be left with your 20% at this point.  If not, and you feel like you need to add some more pieces in, by all means, you should.  BUT.  You are ONLY going to add pieces in IF they fit ALL of your criteria.  Found a really cute top that's jade green, and you know you would look good in it but your accent color is royal blue?  You're not going to buy it.  Super cute black cardigan, but your base color is navy?  No, thanks.  Super cute royal blue blouse that fits your capsule colors, but it's a little too form-fitting and you have to suck in your belly when you sit in a chair?  Hard pass.\n\nJust like you were ruthless with getting things OUT of your closet, you are now going to be ruthless about bringing things IN to your closet.  I buy a LOT of clothes secondhand from ThredUP cuz I'm cheap and ain't no way I'm paying $200 for a pair of jeans thankyouverymuch.  But what I will do is figure out what item I need, such as a pair of flare leg jeans, then buy 10 or 15 pairs off the site at once, try them on at home, and send back everything that doesn't fit me perfectly.  It's a lot of trial and error, but I am no longer wasting money on things that are \"good enough\" when I know if I'm just patient I will find things that I love that are perfect.  I am constantly editing my wardrobe, and if I find that I'm never reaching for a particular shirt, out it goes.  For example, I bought this really pretty blouse with bell sleeves that I really liked, it looked good on me, and I felt good in it, but I found I was never wearing it because the sleeves were just too long and flowy for my lifestyle (I have a messy toddler and I found they just got in the way).  So even though it looked good and I felt good in it, it didn't work for my lifestyle so out it went.  By constantly evaluating whether my items are working for me, it helps me to hone that for future purchases.\n\nMy husband and son both look good in the same colors as me, so all three of us have capsule wardrobes with essentially the same colors.  So we always look good in pictures! :)  As a bonus, laundry is so much easier to do now.  I do one load of laundry every single day that contains all of the clothes from that day for our family of 3.  Other than doing a load of jeans maybe once a week, or a load of the really light colors once a week, we never have a build up of laundry.  I can always find what I'm looking for, and I could list off every single item in my closet right now, in color order because my clothes are categorized by color, which is just soothing to look at.\n\nDecluttering my clothes and going to a capsule wardrobe was one of the first things I did when we started our minimalism journey, and the success I had with that has snowballed and shifted my mindset in relation to owning \"stuff,\" which has made it easy to start decluttering in other areas of my life.\n\nEdit to add: Here's a link to a picture of my closet that contains all of my clothes.  The only thing that doesn't go with my capsule wardrobe is that orange skirt, which my mom made for me in high school so I've kept it because it's sentimental even though it's now a little big on me.  The only things not in the closet are pajamas, undergarments, and workout clothes, which I keep in a dresser drawer, and my three pairs of jeans which are being worn or are in the laundry right now.  The baskets on the shelf contain clothes in the next two sizes up for my toddler.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/W07op3R](https://imgur.com/a/W07op3R)\n\nFurther edit: clarified a few things. Also, for people with breasts, it is CRUCIAL to have properly fitting undergarments, as these will make your clothing look, feel, and fit better.

There&amp;#39;s no way to easily summarize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m active in a lot of decluttering and minimalism groups on Reddit and Facebook, and I frequently see people post about struggling with minimizing clothing.  I often respond to these posts with my experience and methods for decluttering, which I&amp;#39;ve been told numerous times is helpful, so I thought I&amp;#39;d post it here for anyone struggling with this area.  It&amp;#39;s pretty in depth, and goes into more than just the decluttering aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a TON of clothes since I was a teenager, and always had the hardest time getting rid of things.  I never felt comfortable in my skin and always had a hard time finding clothes that I felt looked good on me, partially because of body image issues, and partially because things never seemed to fit me right.  I&amp;#39;m a perfectly average 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; female, but I found that shirts were always really short and showed my belly (which I was self-conscious about) and pants were always really long and dragged on the floor.  It wasn&amp;#39;t until I was in my mid-30s that I finally started to understand WHY clothes never fit me properly, because I happened upon an article that talked about body proportions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure Out What Actually Fits You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, apparently most off-the-rack clothing is designed to fit the &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; person who has generally equal body proportions; that is, their inseam (crotch to floor) length is approximately the same as their torso (crotch to top of head) length.  So, for my very average height of 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;, or 66 inches, my inseam length should be about 33&amp;quot; and my torso (crotch to crown) length should also be about 33&amp;quot;.  However, when I actually measured, my inseam is 30&amp;quot; and my torso is 36&amp;quot;.  I essentially have the legs of someone who is 5 feet tall and the torso of someone who is 6 feet tall.

So my above advice on body measurements can be just as applicable to men as it is to women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a Capsule Wardrobe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I discovered the concept of a capsule wardrobe.

I hate shorts, so I own no shorts other than two pairs of workout shorts.  A capsule wardrobe is not a one-size-fits-all approach; you can customize it to be whatever you want.  If you love pattern and color, by all means, pick several accent colors and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be alarmed at this point how little you have left.  What are you going to wear if you get rid of things in colors that don&amp;#39;t suit you, or styles that don&amp;#39;t fit you?  Well, you&amp;#39;re going to wear things that look good on you and that make you feel good.  And maybe your wardrobe is going to be a little sparse for a while, and that&amp;#39;s okay.  You might find that you get by perfectly fine with a sparse wardrobe.  Maybe the things you have left are the only things that you were wearing anyway, because most people are going to reach for the things that make them look and feel good.  I have no idea how true that saying of &amp;quot;you wear 20% of your clothing 80% of the time&amp;quot; is, but I would guess it&amp;#39;s probably pretty accurate.  You very well might just be left with your 20% at this point.  If not, and you feel like you need to add some more pieces in, by all means, you should.  BUT.  You are ONLY going to add pieces in IF they fit ALL of your criteria.  Found a really cute top that&amp;#39;s jade green, and you know you would look good in it but your accent color is royal blue?  You&amp;#39;re not going to buy it.  Super cute black cardigan, but your base color is navy?  No, thanks.  Super cute royal blue blouse that fits your capsule colors, but it&amp;#39;s a little too form-fitting and you have to suck in your belly when you sit in a chair?  Hard pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like you were ruthless with getting things OUT of your closet, you are now going to be ruthless about bringing things IN to your closet.  I buy a LOT of clothes secondhand from ThredUP cuz I&amp;#39;m cheap and ain&amp;#39;t no way I&amp;#39;m paying $200 for a pair of jeans thankyouverymuch.  But what I will do is figure out what item I need, such as a pair of flare leg jeans, then buy 10 or 15 pairs off the site at once, try them on at home, and send back everything that doesn&amp;#39;t fit me perfectly.  It&amp;#39;s a lot of trial and error, but I am no longer wasting money on things that are &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; when I know if I&amp;#39;m just patient I will find things that I love that are perfect.  I am constantly editing my wardrobe, and if I find that I&amp;#39;m never reaching for a particular shirt, out it goes.  For example, I bought this really pretty blouse with bell sleeves that I really liked, it looked good on me, and I felt good in it, but I found I was never wearing it because the sleeves were just too long and flowy for my lifestyle (I have a messy toddler and I found they just got in the way).  So even though it looked good and I felt good in it, it didn&amp;#39;t work for my lifestyle so out it went.  By constantly evaluating whether my items are working for me, it helps me to hone that for future purchases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and son both look good in the same colors as me, so all three of us have capsule wardrobes with essentially the same colors.  So we always look good in pictures! :)  As a bonus, laundry is so much easier to do now.  I do one load of laundry every single day that contains all of the clothes from that day for our family of 3.  Other than doing a load of jeans maybe once a week, or a load of the really light colors once a week, we never have a build up of laundry.  I can always find what I&amp;#39;m looking for, and I could list off every single item in my closet right now, in color order because my clothes are categorized by color, which is just soothing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decluttering my clothes and going to a capsule wardrobe was one of the first things I did when we started our minimalism journey, and the success I had with that has snowballed and shifted my mindset in relation to owning &amp;quot;stuff,&amp;quot; which has made it easy to start decluttering in other areas of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: Here&amp;#39;s a link to a picture of my closet that contains all of my clothes.  The only thing that doesn&amp;#39;t go with my capsule wardrobe is that orange skirt, which my mom made for me in high school so I&amp;#39;ve kept it because it&amp;#39;s sentimental even though it&amp;#39;s now a little big on me.  The only things not in the closet are pajamas, undergarments, and workout clothes, which I keep in a dresser drawer, and my three pairs of jeans which are being worn or are in the laundry right now.  The baskets on the shelf contain clothes in the next two sizes up for my toddler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/W07op3R\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/W07op3R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further edit: clarified a few things. Also, for people with breasts, it is CRUCIAL to have properly fitting undergarments, as these will make your clothing look, feel, and fit better. I can\u2019t recommend the sub &lt;a href=\"http://www.Reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits\"&gt;www.Reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits&lt;/a&gt; highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

On one hand I hate decision fatigue, would like to have a less overwhelming closet (it\u2019s well-organized, there\u2019s just a lot!) and I like the idea of having every piece of clothing be one of my \u201cfavorites.\u201d On the other hand, I also love the idea of keeping the clothes to have variety and options, so I\u2019m not wearing the same few things all the time (\u2026even though in reality, I do anyway). Does anyone have advice about this? Also, has anyone given away clothes like this and then later regretted it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Btw most of the clothes aren\u2019t wildly expensive, they\u2019re like basic mall brands or Target etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

No job yet either - going to get one when I get there. Because I grew up here despite being a student I have a lot of stuff that my parent constantly gives me/offloads onto me. **I have like 14 garbage bags worth of clothing plus all the household items that I\u2019ve been trying to sell**. I have ADHD and chronic pain so getting this done has been nearly impossible all semester and is still pretty rough at the moment because I\u2019m having a flare-up. Making all these decisions is a bit overwhelming at times and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019ve never moved this far before and I\u2019ve been poor the past 10 years and I think this contributes to a scarcity mindset where I\u2019m afraid to give things away because I feel like I won\u2019t be able to replace it. \n    \nDoes anyone have any advice or know ways to simplify this process? How much should someone in my position bring with them? 20 shirts? 50 shirts? I know it is subjective but I am not sure I can afford to give myself leeway in this situation. \n    \n**My current approach**\n       \nSo far I have put all the summer clothes i think I\u2019ll want in a bag and winter clothing in another (I\u2019ll be returning in the next few months for a celebration of life so I can pick it up then). I have an app called Stylebook which I can use if needed but it takes forever. \n    \nI\u2019ve been giving things away and also selling things on Facebook marketplace and Poshmark but its so exhausting. I\u2019ve made about $350 so far and I still have tons of stuff left. I know there is no life hack and I just need to get it done, but hoping to hear some insight or ideas on what\u2019s feasible for someone if they don\u2019t even have a home of their own to move to yet? And although I can store some stuff with friends or parents, what is worth bringing across an ocean? What is worth taking the time to sell vs. giving away? And should I just cut my losses and donate it all? \n    \n**I feel like I am running a store and moving at the same time**. \n\nI am finding that making decisions on what to keep vs give away isnt the end, I have to then list the things too. And w/ADHD decision fatigue sets in quickly and it feels like I am just hyperfocusing on selling and neglecting the rest of my house and responsibilities before I leave. \n    \n**is this a good plan for decluttering what I\u2019ve sorted through quickly?**   \n    \nI am thinking of having a \u2018firesale\u2019 or garage type sale this Friday on my apartment patio and then donating anything that doesnt sell the next day. But I feel like even just gathering all the other stuff to sell besides clothes is going to be a nightmare. I have housewares, video games, instruments, furniture, electronics to sell. Then there\u2019s the issue of going through junk drawers makeup and things that I need to dispose of and make decisions on keeping for myself and it all seems so futile and overwhelming right now. \n    \nAny advice or tips would be so much appreciated, I usually see tips for families moving or people with disposable income going to a house and it was hard to find advice for someone in my shoes. Thank you!\n    \nI apologize for the awful formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nUPDATE: So I did the freebie day and it was alright! A bunch of people came and took stuff but I am still left with a lot. I was grateful to be able to have it picked up on Monday by the charity but unfortunately my partner missed the call so when they came, nothing got picked up\u2026.so now he\u2019s trying to go drop it off at different places while I clean the house. The apt looks terrible and stuff is strewn everywhere. I am exhausted. On the bright side, thanks to the help of a friend I was able to donate 140 pounds!!! Of clothing to a store whose proceeds go directly to women\u2019s shelters in my area. So that has helped with crowding a lot. Now I am left with packing for my trip and doing remaining laundry (which I\u2019ll take to my mom\u2019s house since my coin machine sucks). Thank you to everyone for all the advice, it really helped me to just let go of everything and give away everything that I was on the fence about. Next big thing will be going through paperwork and stuff.",

Because I grew up here despite being a student I have a lot of stuff that my parent constantly gives me/offloads onto me. &lt;strong&gt;I have like 14 garbage bags worth of clothing plus all the household items that I\u2019ve been trying to sell&lt;/strong&gt;. I have ADHD and chronic pain so getting this done has been nearly impossible all semester and is still pretty rough at the moment because I\u2019m having a flare-up. Making all these decisions is a bit overwhelming at times and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019ve never moved this far before and I\u2019ve been poor the past 10 years and I think this contributes to a scarcity mindset where I\u2019m afraid to give things away because I feel like I won\u2019t be able to replace it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice or know ways to simplify this process? How much should someone in my position bring with them? 20 shirts? 50 shirts? I know it is subjective but I am not sure I can afford to give myself leeway in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My current approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I have put all the summer clothes i think I\u2019ll want in a bag and winter clothing in another (I\u2019ll be returning in the next few months for a celebration of life so I can pick it up then). I have an app called Stylebook which I can use if needed but it takes forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been giving things away and also selling things on Facebook marketplace and Poshmark but its so exhausting. I\u2019ve made about $350 so far and I still have tons of stuff left. I know there is no life hack and I just need to get it done, but hoping to hear some insight or ideas on what\u2019s feasible for someone if they don\u2019t even have a home of their own to move to yet? And although I can store some stuff with friends or parents, what is worth bringing across an ocean? What is worth taking the time to sell vs. giving away? And should I just cut my losses and donate it all? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I am running a store and moving at the same time&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am finding that making decisions on what to keep vs give away isnt the end, I have to then list the things too. And w/ADHD decision fatigue sets in quickly and it feels like I am just hyperfocusing on selling and neglecting the rest of my house and responsibilities before I leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is this a good plan for decluttering what I\u2019ve sorted through quickly?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of having a \u2018firesale\u2019 or garage type sale this Friday on my apartment patio and then donating anything that doesnt sell the next day. But I feel like even just gathering all the other stuff to sell besides clothes is going to be a nightmare. I have housewares, video games, instruments, furniture, electronics to sell. Then there\u2019s the issue of going through junk drawers makeup and things that I need to dispose of and make decisions on keeping for myself and it all seems so futile and overwhelming right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice or tips would be so much appreciated, I usually see tips for families moving or people with disposable income going to a house and it was hard to find advice for someone in my shoes. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the awful formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: So I did the freebie day and it was alright! A bunch of people came and took stuff but I am still left with a lot. I was grateful to be able to have it picked up on Monday by the charity but unfortunately my partner missed the call so when they came, nothing got picked up\u2026.so now he\u2019s trying to go drop it off at different places while I clean the house. The apt looks terrible and stuff is strewn everywhere. I am exhausted. On the bright side, thanks to the help of a friend I was able to donate 140 pounds!!! Of clothing to a store whose proceeds go directly to women\u2019s shelters in my area. So that has helped with crowding a lot. Now I am left with packing for my trip and doing remaining laundry (which I\u2019ll take to my mom\u2019s house since my coin machine sucks). Thank you to everyone for all the advice, it really helped me to just let go of everything and give away everything that I was on the fence about. Next big thing will be going through paperwork and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019ve also seen a lot of posts here asking some variation of \u201chow do I get my parents to declutter?!\u201d\n\nFor a couple days I\u2019ve been helping my mom clean (dad is another story entirely) and here\u2019s what has worked for us:\n\n-ask her where to start, what\u2019s urgent for me is immaterial for her\n\n-keep her focused on the why, clean off the table so we can move it tonight \n\n-do most of the leg work like taking out trash and moving items to another room \n\n-clean as we go, sweeping up the floor makes her want to get more floor showing\n\n-ask \u201ckeep, toss or donate?\u201d and don\u2019t judge unless it\u2019s a clear WTF\n\n-set up a box for memorabilia and pictures and save all that\u2019s important - well to an extent, kept a high school cap but tossed 40 yo wedding decorations. \n\n-PRAISE when she throws something out or donates. Stay quiet when something is saved. Might be devious but pavlovs dog and all. \n\n-ask \u201care you sure?\u201d for keep items occasionally. My mom wanted to give me a portable thread organizer and I declined and suggested to donate it. She put it back in her closet only to pull it out and donate a few minutes later. \n\n-if you\u2019re working with a lot of paper start file folders as soon as possible, even if it\u2019s a duplicate folder you can put a new label on top. Don\u2019t let piles pile up, that\u2019s how the mess begins\n\n-let them sit and rest, bring in water and juice, light a candle if it\u2019s safe and play some music. \n\n-just turning off the TV was a huge win as it\u2019s this energy and time suck and my parents can\u2019t multitask. \n\n-be okay leaving some decisions for later, decision fatigue is real\n\n-label whatever you can, we used a lot of plastic bins and existing organizers in a craft room to keep things tidy\n\n-take breaks, walk the dogs, talk about how great they\u2019re doing and how much easier it will be to work. \n\nBoth of my parents are having some physical issues and I\u2019m 30 years younger so that means help is carrying stuff, getting down on the floor, moving tools, delivering cold water - whatever is needed to move things along. \n\nAside from the fact I know they\u2019ll be happier, I consider this time an investment in my future so I don\u2019t have to deal with all of it when they pass.\n\nBONUS: if it\u2019s not embarrassing for them, brag to their friends and neighbors about the hard work they\u2019re doing. Having someone come see the progress is motivating and when several people have suggested borrowing me (because everyone has a mess somewhere), I think they\u2019re a little more grateful.\n\nETA: thanks for the encouragement everyone! Today we managed to tackle the food pantry and not only get it organized but LABELS on all the shelves (minor setback with 3 label makers and all had dead batteries!) and then the thread from the sewing stash. I would say a conservative estimate is 300 spools of thread plus bobbins. All organized and put away again. I also snuck in painting a door even though the paint color they matched was 2 months old and had settled quite badly. Tomorrow is a new day!",

I\u2019ve also seen a lot of posts here asking some variation of \u201chow do I get my parents to declutter?!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a couple days I\u2019ve been helping my mom clean (dad is another story entirely) and here\u2019s what has worked for us:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ask her where to start, what\u2019s urgent for me is immaterial for her&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-keep her focused on the why, clean off the table so we can move it tonight &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-do most of the leg work like taking out trash and moving items to another room &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-clean as we go, sweeping up the floor makes her want to get more floor showing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ask \u201ckeep, toss or donate?\u201d and don\u2019t judge unless it\u2019s a clear WTF&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-set up a box for memorabilia and pictures and save all that\u2019s important - well to an extent, kept a high school cap but tossed 40 yo wedding decorations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-PRAISE when she throws something out or donates. Stay quiet when something is saved. Might be devious but pavlovs dog and all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-ask \u201care you sure?\u201d for keep items occasionally. My mom wanted to give me a portable thread organizer and I declined and suggested to donate it. She put it back in her closet only to pull it out and donate a few minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-if you\u2019re working with a lot of paper start file folders as soon as possible, even if it\u2019s a duplicate folder you can put a new label on top. Don\u2019t let piles pile up, that\u2019s how the mess begins&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-let them sit and rest, bring in water and juice, light a candle if it\u2019s safe and play some music. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-just turning off the TV was a huge win as it\u2019s this energy and time suck and my parents can\u2019t multitask. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-be okay leaving some decisions for later, decision fatigue is real&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-label whatever you can, we used a lot of plastic bins and existing organizers in a craft room to keep things tidy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-take breaks, walk the dogs, talk about how great they\u2019re doing and how much easier it will be to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of my parents are having some physical issues and I\u2019m 30 years younger so that means help is carrying stuff, getting down on the floor, moving tools, delivering cold water - whatever is needed to move things along. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact I know they\u2019ll be happier, I consider this time an investment in my future so I don\u2019t have to deal with all of it when they pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BONUS: if it\u2019s not embarrassing for them, brag to their friends and neighbors about the hard work they\u2019re doing. Having someone come see the progress is motivating and when several people have suggested borrowing me (because everyone has a mess somewhere), I think they\u2019re a little more grateful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: thanks for the encouragement everyone! Today we managed to tackle the food pantry and not only get it organized but LABELS on all the shelves (minor setback with 3 label makers and all had dead batteries!) and then the thread from the sewing stash. I would say a conservative estimate is 300 spools of thread plus bobbins. All organized and put away again. I also snuck in painting a door even though the paint color they matched was 2 months old and had settled quite badly. Tomorrow is a new day!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Just a few clothes you wear, a few toiletries, a few bare-minimum cooking utensils, the electronics you brought such as one laptop/tablet/phone.\n\nI really struggle with making messes and keeping up with the house (I also live with a sick partner so that greatly impacts my decision).\n\nSo for example, maybe I only need 7 sweaters in the winter. Only 7 would allow me to pick the best 7 so I feel the best, have minimal laundry so my laundry basket isn\u2019t constantly overflowing, significantly reduce decision fatigue. But right now, I have more than 7 sweaters! And I love them. And they spark *joy*. And they are unique to me!\n\nSimilarly, I love to bake. I\u2019ve built up a little collection of items over the years. Several pans, decorating supplies, boxes, cooling racks, and so on. These things are useful to me, and I love having them.\n\nI also have a lot of old school materials I would like to keep.\n\nI don\u2019t want to just declutter things I love.\n\nHowever, my issue is that I *want to* keep these things, but I am going back to college while still working full time and don\u2019t really want excess in my small apartment because it\u2019s overwhelming. I won\u2019t be baking much in college, I won\u2019t be looking at old materials, I can\u2019t spend thirty minutes trying to decide what to wear in the morning.\n\nI can\u2019t have these items now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to get rid of them forever (I would donate, wouldn\u2019t throw anything out btw. Well except my old school materials, those would have to be recycled).\n\nI also don\u2019t like having random odds-and-ends because my apartment doesn\u2019t have any built-in storage so I have things like a cardboard \u201cwire box\u201d (instead of drawer), suitcases lining the wall filled with books/games/clothes, plastic bins in corners filled with miscellaneous things such as Holiday supplies and my home maintenance supplies (Tool kit, nails, that sort of thing).\n\nI can\u2019t even replace these poor storage solutions because my partner will say \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have room for any shelves/organization system/anything! Don\u2019t bring anything in here, it is FULL\u201d which is also true-ish. \n\nThe tiniest storage unit in my area is $55 a month, or $660 a year. I\u2019m also pretty poor and that\u2019s a lot of money. Honestly for $660, I could probably just get rid of my baking supplies &amp; clothes and replace them\u2026. but I don\u2019t want to. I like a lot of the stuff I have. It\u2019s familiar to me and I hate losing things. I hate looking back and going, \u201cOh, where is that top I\u2019m wearing in that picture? I haven\u2019t seen it in a few years\u201d and I feel sad. So even when I do declutter generally, I\u2019ll have to take a picture of the item and probably create a word document with a \u201cReview\u201d of why it\u2019s leaving. I need to go back and see, \u201cI\u2019m getting rid of this sweater because the sleeves are too short and you never felt comfortable wearing it.\u201d so I can feel peace and reassurance, instead of loss at the the sweater I remembered loving and is now gone.\n\nAlso, I worked really hard to get the things that I have. Some of the baking supplies I have, they spent *years* on an online shopping list before I had extra money to purchase or was able to treat myself. I don\u2019t want to ruin or waste that hard work. \nAnd, I might not actually have the means to replace anything. I will \u201ctheoretically\u201d be saving $660 in the first year by not buying these things, but that\u2019s not an actual saving. Maybe I could transfer $55 a month into a savings account, but what if I find out school needs more attention and have to find a job with less hours so I\u2019m not able to have any extra money at the end of the month and I\u2019ve just set myself back literal years?\n\nA lot of thoughts, thank you",

I've made a bunch of progress, which I am pretty proud of and I feel a lot better about the amount of stuff I have and how it is being stored. I know some people can just get rid of unopened boxes but I knew that I had to go through everything before sending it to the trash/donate pile. I did find a lot of things I didn't remember keeping (a large trash bag of highschool notebooks? Like why?), all I can think is that at the time I was going through I lot of family turmoil which probably heightened my need to keep them for whatever reason. I only had one small shoe box (of unimportant stuff) that had been ruined by mice nesting in it, everything else was untouched including a box filled with different kinds of cereal grains that I couldn't for the life of me figure out why I had kept -.eventually I did figure it out, I'd tried to use this box as a trap to catch an escaped pet mouse (unsuccessful) and my mum had packed it into my stuff accidentally. \n\nI didn't do all this on my own (probably would have given up from the decision fatigue) but once I had decided what I wanted to keep, my mother would go through the rest and decide what could be donated or what had to be trashed. \n\nI ended up getting rid of 300-400 litres of paper from highschool and primary school. I got rid of probably 200 litres of toys and toy accessories. 20 books, 50+ VHS tapes, 2 fish tanks and an old (but not good) record player. I still need to go through more VHS tapes and books but I needed a break from making decisions and dealing with emotions around objects.\n\nI now have 5x 30 litre and 2x 60 litres boxes filled with toys I want to keep, precious papers (stories, precious drawings and cards, letters etc) and a few other things. So I get rid of a bunch of stuff (probably more than I have listed). I wish I was able to take a photo of it all together but as my mum went through it she took it to charity and/or gave our friends the chance to take whatever they wanted. I only removed 3 things from  the donation box (which I placed there) because I couldn't stop thinking about them (over multiple days). My mother has realised she has some boxes that she needs to go through as well and so does my brother (turns out not all the 20+ boxes were mine).\n\n\nI was able to talk with my brother and have handed the grandparents record collection (bar some elvis and aretha franklin records) and our fathers coin collection on to him and we discussed giving away a few other things that he had given me that I was concerned he may want back which really helped to ease my anxiety about getting rid of them.  My brother doesn't like to ask for things he wants, and because I am ok with asking and/or accepting items I have inherited a bunch of things from my father. I know some of you are probably going to say I shouldn't do this (because he hasn't asked for them directly) and I shouldn't unload stuff onto him but I am the only one who knows my brother and I know that he wants my dads old collection of Larson comics and a chess table (which has birthday/xmas presents sorted for awhile). So I am getting rid of stuff I didn't think I was going to get rid of!\n\n\nI am really glad I did go through everything because I found some cash but more importantly I was able to find my grandma's opal (which I had \"misplaced\" probably 10+ years ago) and my grandfathers film camera + a bonus film camera I didn't even remember I owned; which I am really excited about because I want to get back into photography (film in particular). Finding these things helped me realise that some of my items are a lot more precious to me than some of the junk I was keeping - which was very important in my process.\n\n\nTL;DR: Got rid of a bunch of stuff, still a work in progress. Advice: Don't delay  dealing with your stuff because your anxious of its condition.  Ask for help in the clearing out process from people you can trust and talk about your feelings/emotions/anxiety you've placed on the items with other parties the item may concern if you need to.\n\n",

I&amp;#39;ve made a bunch of progress, which I am pretty proud of and I feel a lot better about the amount of stuff I have and how it is being stored. I know some people can just get rid of unopened boxes but I knew that I had to go through everything before sending it to the trash/donate pile. I did find a lot of things I didn&amp;#39;t remember keeping (a large trash bag of highschool notebooks? Like why?), all I can think is that at the time I was going through I lot of family turmoil which probably heightened my need to keep them for whatever reason. I only had one small shoe box (of unimportant stuff) that had been ruined by mice nesting in it, everything else was untouched including a box filled with different kinds of cereal grains that I couldn&amp;#39;t for the life of me figure out why I had kept -.eventually I did figure it out, I&amp;#39;d tried to use this box as a trap to catch an escaped pet mouse (unsuccessful) and my mum had packed it into my stuff accidentally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t do all this on my own (probably would have given up from the decision fatigue) but once I had decided what I wanted to keep, my mother would go through the rest and decide what could be donated or what had to be trashed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting rid of 300-400 litres of paper from highschool and primary school. I got rid of probably 200 litres of toys and toy accessories. 20 books, 50+ VHS tapes, 2 fish tanks and an old (but not good) record player. I still need to go through more VHS tapes and books but I needed a break from making decisions and dealing with emotions around objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now have 5x 30 litre and 2x 60 litres boxes filled with toys I want to keep, precious papers (stories, precious drawings and cards, letters etc) and a few other things. So I get rid of a bunch of stuff (probably more than I have listed). I wish I was able to take a photo of it all together but as my mum went through it she took it to charity and/or gave our friends the chance to take whatever they wanted. I only removed 3 things from  the donation box (which I placed there) because I couldn&amp;#39;t stop thinking about them (over multiple days). My mother has realised she has some boxes that she needs to go through as well and so does my brother (turns out not all the 20+ boxes were mine).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to talk with my brother and have handed the grandparents record collection (bar some elvis and aretha franklin records) and our fathers coin collection on to him and we discussed giving away a few other things that he had given me that I was concerned he may want back which really helped to ease my anxiety about getting rid of them.  My brother doesn&amp;#39;t like to ask for things he wants, and because I am ok with asking and/or accepting items I have inherited a bunch of things from my father. I know some of you are probably going to say I shouldn&amp;#39;t do this (because he hasn&amp;#39;t asked for them directly) and I shouldn&amp;#39;t unload stuff onto him but I am the only one who knows my brother and I know that he wants my dads old collection of Larson comics and a chess table (which has birthday/xmas presents sorted for awhile). So I am getting rid of stuff I didn&amp;#39;t think I was going to get rid of!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really glad I did go through everything because I found some cash but more importantly I was able to find my grandma&amp;#39;s opal (which I had &amp;quot;misplaced&amp;quot; probably 10+ years ago) and my grandfathers film camera + a bonus film camera I didn&amp;#39;t even remember I owned; which I am really excited about because I want to get back into photography (film in particular). Finding these things helped me realise that some of my items are a lot more precious to me than some of the junk I was keeping - which was very important in my process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Got rid of a bunch of stuff, still a work in progress. Advice: Don&amp;#39;t delay  dealing with your stuff because your anxious of its condition.  Ask for help in the clearing out process from people you can trust and talk about your feelings/emotions/anxiety you&amp;#39;ve placed on the items with other parties the item may concern if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The pile was a little overwhelming, but the truth is it wasn't so bad!  \n\nManuals - everything i have i can find online.  Goodbye &amp; thank you for answering my potential questions!\nNotebooks from school - I've passed the biggest licensure test i will need for my career (professional engineer exam).  I skimmed them for drawings/letters that would be interesting, but i'm not even sure how to read my notes from differential equations!  Thank you for helping me pass my classes.\nRecipes - The internet means i don't look at these hardly ever.  The family ones i will scan and put into Evernote.\nWorkshop handouts/workbooks - I've attended a few conferences and workshops in the last few years for hobbies and keep the notes/handouts.  I will be scanning these and putting them into Evernote, where i can actually reference them.  I have found that many i do like to reference when writing or preparing my own classes. \n\nI kept some art by friends, astronomy tools, some medical papers (i need them for OSHA documentation), certificates of training (again, work) and the like.  \n\nHere's the album for the photographic evidence: http://imgur.com/a/sIcUq\n\nI also began komono, but tried to start with my accessories.  This was a bad idea, particularly after doing it the same day as paper.  I hit decision fatigue and kept a lot.  I'll be re-doing what i kept when i get there on the list.\n\nHere's those pictures: http://imgur.com/a/rjPw9\n\nThis morning i get back to doing things in order and took on the start of komono with CDs &amp; DVDs.  I've been given a lot of DVDs as gifts, so this was a little loaded, but it really wasn't bad.  I'm hoping husband won't put some back.  They are definitely one of those areas where items don't have a distinct owner.\n\nI hear many people talk about books as friends and that's CDs for me.  I enjoy music and so many CDs have given me fun memories and emotional connections.  This wasn't easy!  But the truth is some were ready to be let go.  I don't have to keep CDs from middle school that were popular but not \"my thing\".  I don't have to keep all of the Best Of's that i got from a record club.  \n\nHere's those pictures too: http://imgur.com/a/qHmcn\n\nNext up is skin care and make up, which i think i will try to do this weekend.  I'm finding i can only do so much a day without feeling overwhelmed.   ",

The pile was a little overwhelming, but the truth is it wasn&amp;#39;t so bad!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manuals - everything i have i can find online.  Goodbye &amp;amp; thank you for answering my potential questions!\nNotebooks from school - I&amp;#39;ve passed the biggest licensure test i will need for my career (professional engineer exam).  I skimmed them for drawings/letters that would be interesting, but i&amp;#39;m not even sure how to read my notes from differential equations!  Thank you for helping me pass my classes.\nRecipes - The internet means i don&amp;#39;t look at these hardly ever.  The family ones i will scan and put into Evernote.\nWorkshop handouts/workbooks - I&amp;#39;ve attended a few conferences and workshops in the last few years for hobbies and keep the notes/handouts.  I will be scanning these and putting them into Evernote, where i can actually reference them.  I have found that many i do like to reference when writing or preparing my own classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept some art by friends, astronomy tools, some medical papers (i need them for OSHA documentation), certificates of training (again, work) and the like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the album for the photographic evidence: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/sIcUq\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/sIcUq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also began komono, but tried to start with my accessories.  This was a bad idea, particularly after doing it the same day as paper.  I hit decision fatigue and kept a lot.  I&amp;#39;ll be re-doing what i kept when i get there on the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s those pictures: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/rjPw9\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/rjPw9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning i get back to doing things in order and took on the start of komono with CDs &amp;amp; DVDs.  I&amp;#39;ve been given a lot of DVDs as gifts, so this was a little loaded, but it really wasn&amp;#39;t bad.  I&amp;#39;m hoping husband won&amp;#39;t put some back.  They are definitely one of those areas where items don&amp;#39;t have a distinct owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear many people talk about books as friends and that&amp;#39;s CDs for me.  I enjoy music and so many CDs have given me fun memories and emotional connections.  This wasn&amp;#39;t easy!  But the truth is some were ready to be let go.  I don&amp;#39;t have to keep CDs from middle school that were popular but not &amp;quot;my thing&amp;quot;.  I don&amp;#39;t have to keep all of the Best Of&amp;#39;s that i got from a record club.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s those pictures too: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/qHmcn\"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/qHmcn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up is skin care and make up, which i think i will try to do this weekend.  I&amp;#39;m finding i can only do so much a day without feeling overwhelmed.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
