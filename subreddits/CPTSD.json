I'm exhausted at trying to find out what I like and try to share it with people.\n\n\\----\n\nA lot of my (28NB) trauma stems from the fact that I (1) moved around a lot as a kid or was threatened by my mom to move any time she was unhappy, (2) was strong armed by my mom to sing, dance, act, etc. even though I HATED it and begged her to stop making me do things - this lasted until college (which she strong armed me into as well), and (3) when she wasn't controlling me to do these things, she was either neglecting me, competing with me (through angry disapproval, silence, or 1-upping when I was excited), or comparing me to my brother, who was / is golden to her. He was encouraged to have hobbies and I often got his hand-me-downs or had to watch what he wanted to. I have a bunch of useless knowledge of shows / music tastes I don't even like because that's what he enjoyed.\n\nAs a result, I learned to shut off all interests at home for fear of my mom sabotaging them in an attempt to replace them with her interests. I learned to hate her smile because I associate that with her attempting to manipulate me into doing something. When I was among peers doing these activities I hated, I couldn't relate to them because I didn't enjoy what I was doing. Or, because I moved a lot, friends that I would make would come / go and all of the relationships I've built would reset and I'd have to start from square 1 with people. I learned to be a total chameleon socially and just adopt others interests to survive being the new kid. I learned to stop even trying to be people's friends because I'd just have to move again. I overachieved in school / at work (still do) because that's the only place where I felt safe and that my curiosity was encouraged.\n\nNow  I have been working on my CPTSD a lot through EMDR, mindful eating, working out, etc. and am LC with my mom (considering NC); I'm starting to make way for my own interests and find myself among people who had 'normal' childhoods in that they fondly remember shows, sports, games, friendships, experiences that were either nurtured by their parents or weren't squashed by their parents. My dissociation is so bad that I don't remember a lot of my childhood and of what I remember, it's really sad. So now I'm at the point where in the company of others, I shut down, making way for them to gush about their interests while I'm paralyzed in fear. I don't often share my interests with people without them having to point-blank ask me as a means of getting me to talk. When I do share an interest (say something music related), I'm met with gatekeeping energy or name-every-album energy (maybe my projection) or you-HAD-to-go-to-this-concert-when-you-were-16-to-really-enjoy-it-like-I-do energy or spoiler energy (so now I can't discover the thing myself / find out what I do / don't like about it, I have to listen to an expert). The people I surround myself are well intentioned and imo should hold their passions so dearly - most of this energy is fed by my trauma / fear of my mom competing with me. Often times, they have no idea of the extent of my trauma and for those I do share it with, I have to explain that I'm at square 1 with an interest, still at the kid stage. If they have a well-developed passion, they don't necessarily want to take a beginner under their wing, or listen to my stories about trauma - again.\n\nI'm at the point where there are so many ways I could reparent myself (start playing pokemon, watch sailor moon, run around / bike outside, do pottery, work on art / poetry / etc, rock climbing), and i'm a beginner at so many things, that I just feel wholly inadequate at figuring out what makes me happy, and further incapable of forming community around things.  I have a job /responsibilities now, a lot of communities are not beginner welcoming (could be an internalized belief), and finding hobbies by trial and error is expensive. When my shame is at its worst, I tell myself that I can't make up for lost time / the childhood at had, so what's the point.\n\nCan anyone relate? Anyone have advice?",

                    "selftext": "This is another daily post as part of my promise to myself to write every day. Thanks as always to everyone who reads this, particularly if they let me know. Knowing that people are reading helps me keep going.\n\nDay 9 is over. I walked, meditated and wrote today. That's 9 days in a row, a real streak. \n\nI feel foolish writing this on a cPTSD forum but things seem to have been going well lately. Funny how no matter what I write I think it's foolish, but it's the truth. Today was a good day. I didn't walk all that much or work all that much. Didn't meditate in the morning at all and there's still a few things hanging over my head to do. But nevertheless, the day went well.\n\nI really don't know what to attribute good and bad days to. My wife says it's the weather and seasons and that I always crash as it starts to get cooler. She's probably right but I don't know if it's the only reason. I thought that staying out of big cities helped my stress but I just spent 2 days in the city and I think my stress levels are lower than they've been this whole 9-day journey.\n\nOne big thing is that a couple of things I was worried about are now mostly settled. They were never really things to worry about in the first place but I didn't \\*realize\\* this until yesterday. I guess to pull a simple conclusion out of that--if I'm worried about something it's less likely to be a good day. No matter if the thing is worthy of generating worry or not.\n\nMy guess is that the next step to this quasi-conclusion is that it's actually good to just not worry at all. This is a hard one to tackle. On the one hand I'd rather not think about anything much at all and just focus on the task at hand, no matter what it is. On the other hand, if I don't make lists and organize my priorities and to-dos, things get dropped and then I have more things to worry about--things that really did need to get done and so are justifiably worrisome.\n\nSo maybe this is why writing every day is a good thing. I sure hope so since it's what I've committed to. \n\nMy plan for tomorrow is to get up even earlier than I usually do and actually walk to a place outside to meditate. We'll see how the sleep-schedule aspect of this works out. Maybe the sleep deprivation will help, as it has helped in previous days. Maybe I'll crash from exhaustion.\n\nThis is another thing that's been really hard to judge. I went to sleep past midnight last night and got up before 6am. I didn't sleep much the night before that so I should be feeling pretty groggy right now. But I'm not. I'm tired but, not any more than I usually would be around bedtime. \n\nI think I have some meeting in the morning and I'll have some work jobs in the afternoon. But most of the day should be pretty flexible. I guess I'll work on my e-mail backlog and try to get a task-management system up and running.\n\nI say this knowing that in the past couple months, I've said the same thing and wind up getting super distracted. Some e-mails require further work to consider an appropriate response and in doing this secondary task, I often get lost and forget where to come back to. Like I'll get an e-mail asking if I can do something on a certain date. But when I go to check my calendar, I start looking at other dates and don't remember why I opened the calendar in the first place.\n\nAnother reason I get lost is because it's hard to get a sense of what to work on when. My e-mail and task backlogs go back years. Obviously some of the jobs are so old I may as well forget about them. But it's hard to make that decision. And I feel guilty deleting something when I know I should have responded or done the thing at some point. I remember reading about this idea of \"e-mail bankruptcy,\" declaring all unanswered e-mails null at a certain point, and thinking it was a great idea but that I'd never be capable of doing it. Maybe I should reconsider that, but I don't think I'll do it tomorrow.\n\nThe other thing to decide is where I'll do the work. If I want to do it outside, I'll need to come back home after the walk to pick up my laptop. If I do it inside then obviously I don't need to make two trips. I am not sure what to do about this one. \n\n\\--\n\nActually you know what, I have an idea. I'll walk to the meditation place in the early morning, do the meditation and then walk back home. That's only an hour of walking but it's not nothing and the walking-meditate-walking routine is an easy one to repeat in future days if I want to. And it puts me right back at home early so I can decide then if I want to repack and head out again. Which means I don't have to decide now, yay.\n\nSo maybe putting off decisions is good sometimes.",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another daily post as part of my promise to myself to write every day. Thanks as always to everyone who reads this, particularly if they let me know. Knowing that people are reading helps me keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 9 is over. I walked, meditated and wrote today. That&amp;#39;s 9 days in a row, a real streak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel foolish writing this on a cPTSD forum but things seem to have been going well lately. Funny how no matter what I write I think it&amp;#39;s foolish, but it&amp;#39;s the truth. Today was a good day. I didn&amp;#39;t walk all that much or work all that much. Didn&amp;#39;t meditate in the morning at all and there&amp;#39;s still a few things hanging over my head to do. But nevertheless, the day went well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know what to attribute good and bad days to. My wife says it&amp;#39;s the weather and seasons and that I always crash as it starts to get cooler. She&amp;#39;s probably right but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the only reason. I thought that staying out of big cities helped my stress but I just spent 2 days in the city and I think my stress levels are lower than they&amp;#39;ve been this whole 9-day journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One big thing is that a couple of things I was worried about are now mostly settled. They were never really things to worry about in the first place but I didn&amp;#39;t *realize* this until yesterday. I guess to pull a simple conclusion out of that--if I&amp;#39;m worried about something it&amp;#39;s less likely to be a good day. No matter if the thing is worthy of generating worry or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the next step to this quasi-conclusion is that it&amp;#39;s actually good to just not worry at all. This is a hard one to tackle. On the one hand I&amp;#39;d rather not think about anything much at all and just focus on the task at hand, no matter what it is. On the other hand, if I don&amp;#39;t make lists and organize my priorities and to-dos, things get dropped and then I have more things to worry about--things that really did need to get done and so are justifiably worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe this is why writing every day is a good thing. I sure hope so since it&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve committed to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan for tomorrow is to get up even earlier than I usually do and actually walk to a place outside to meditate. We&amp;#39;ll see how the sleep-schedule aspect of this works out. Maybe the sleep deprivation will help, as it has helped in previous days. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll crash from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is another thing that&amp;#39;s been really hard to judge. I went to sleep past midnight last night and got up before 6am. I didn&amp;#39;t sleep much the night before that so I should be feeling pretty groggy right now. But I&amp;#39;m not. I&amp;#39;m tired but, not any more than I usually would be around bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I have some meeting in the morning and I&amp;#39;ll have some work jobs in the afternoon. But most of the day should be pretty flexible. I guess I&amp;#39;ll work on my e-mail backlog and try to get a task-management system up and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say this knowing that in the past couple months, I&amp;#39;ve said the same thing and wind up getting super distracted. Some e-mails require further work to consider an appropriate response and in doing this secondary task, I often get lost and forget where to come back to. Like I&amp;#39;ll get an e-mail asking if I can do something on a certain date. But when I go to check my calendar, I start looking at other dates and don&amp;#39;t remember why I opened the calendar in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another reason I get lost is because it&amp;#39;s hard to get a sense of what to work on when. My e-mail and task backlogs go back years. Obviously some of the jobs are so old I may as well forget about them. But it&amp;#39;s hard to make that decision. And I feel guilty deleting something when I know I should have responded or done the thing at some point. I remember reading about this idea of &amp;quot;e-mail bankruptcy,&amp;quot; declaring all unanswered e-mails null at a certain point, and thinking it was a great idea but that I&amp;#39;d never be capable of doing it. Maybe I should reconsider that, but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll do it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing to decide is where I&amp;#39;ll do the work. If I want to do it outside, I&amp;#39;ll need to come back home after the walk to pick up my laptop. If I do it inside then obviously I don&amp;#39;t need to make two trips. I am not sure what to do about this one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually you know what, I have an idea. I&amp;#39;ll walk to the meditation place in the early morning, do the meditation and then walk back home. That&amp;#39;s only an hour of walking but it&amp;#39;s not nothing and the walking-meditate-walking routine is an easy one to repeat in future days if I want to. And it puts me right back at home early so I can decide then if I want to repack and head out again. Which means I don&amp;#39;t have to decide now, yay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe putting off decisions is good sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The idea of losing all of this familiarity when I am already so fucking lonely struggling to make meaningful friendships in a transient big city away from home. I recently lost a long-term friendship that I was neglecting to set boundaries with and many others due to toxicity or changes of life. And it is already really hard for me to meet men who peek my romantic interest.\n\nA few days ago my therapist found a wound from my teenage years. She held space and validated that part of me. It was beautiful and more helpful than I thought. It led me down a rabbit hole about CPTSD and attachment theory. All of this with stress has opened up memories and emotional flashbacks I wasn't even ready to experience. The constant invalidation from my parents, the bullying, the gaslighting, the abandonment, the telling me exactly who I am etc and the little me feeling neglected or teenage rage. I'm working to validate those parts of me but fuuuuuck.\n\nI'm in the middle of making some major life decisions that I have a lot of procrastination and decision fatigue over. The research of my decision often feels like a mountain due to my lack of ability to focus for long periods of time and no life balance whatsoever. I am currently without a permanent living situation as I'm trying to decide if I should move closer to home and be near my parents as they age or stay in this city and still chase some dreams. And yes although being near my parents seems toxic, I would be 8 hrs away. They are in their mid 60s and I am terrified to not get enough time with them. Living in the city I'm in for the past 2.5 years has been very stressful and lonely so far but I feel that it could be my CPTSD holding me back from flourishing but it's hard to feel connected to a place that I have little to no support system in. Or is it better to be away from the root source of this trauma?\n\nI keep participating in some self destructive behavior and I feel like I am drowning. What would you do? How did you cope with this weird shift of healing and losing people left and right? How did you build your supportive environment for healing?",

The idea of losing all of this familiarity when I am already so fucking lonely struggling to make meaningful friendships in a transient big city away from home. I recently lost a long-term friendship that I was neglecting to set boundaries with and many others due to toxicity or changes of life. And it is already really hard for me to meet men who peek my romantic interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago my therapist found a wound from my teenage years. She held space and validated that part of me. It was beautiful and more helpful than I thought. It led me down a rabbit hole about CPTSD and attachment theory. All of this with stress has opened up memories and emotional flashbacks I wasn&amp;#39;t even ready to experience. The constant invalidation from my parents, the bullying, the gaslighting, the abandonment, the telling me exactly who I am etc and the little me feeling neglected or teenage rage. I&amp;#39;m working to validate those parts of me but fuuuuuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the middle of making some major life decisions that I have a lot of procrastination and decision fatigue over. The research of my decision often feels like a mountain due to my lack of ability to focus for long periods of time and no life balance whatsoever. I am currently without a permanent living situation as I&amp;#39;m trying to decide if I should move closer to home and be near my parents as they age or stay in this city and still chase some dreams. And yes although being near my parents seems toxic, I would be 8 hrs away. They are in their mid 60s and I am terrified to not get enough time with them. Living in the city I&amp;#39;m in for the past 2.5 years has been very stressful and lonely so far but I feel that it could be my CPTSD holding me back from flourishing but it&amp;#39;s hard to feel connected to a place that I have little to no support system in. Or is it better to be away from the root source of this trauma?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep participating in some self destructive behavior and I feel like I am drowning. What would you do? How did you cope with this weird shift of healing and losing people left and right? How did you build your supportive environment for healing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I struggle with a lot of generalized and social anxiety...  \nthis basically boils down to feeling the need to choose between home improvements, buying new things like pants but also from me somewhat hurting inside and wanting a new pc mid-prace range that can run games so I can relax and have adventures of the mind besides taking care of life, body and hobbies I want to pursue for certain too. There is an old core of addiction inside me because computer games were one of the few things that made me cope in the past through school and my parents place and I do miss roaming fantasy worlds and seeing the art and beauty of them. The defining difference between now and then is that I can go outside and not fear for my physical safety. I am aware that it is escapism in its core as is reading fiction books and I do not know how much I can view it as grounding and relaxing... there might be a part that would like to put up tent in such a world and live there indefinitely because it had a warming effect on my in the absence of other things in my past.   \nOn the other side is me not for very much longer having the option to sign up for all the steps to go a journey abroad to work and travel, meet new people and hopefully have a good time and great experiences. I have certainly become scared of it after some time initiating some steps towards it because it feels so big and uncertain and I have chronic illnesses. A few years back I did a road tour to Spain through a few other countries too and took pain meds every single day during all of it I think because it was impossible to take enough care of my body's needs the way the journey was set to be taken by my companions on the road and my professor's guidelines at the destination.  \nAnd daily life has been two opposing wants and needs battling for hierarchy inside me. The one who rather reclines and sees the green grass on this patch here and improving the space I have for certain for now today vs the one who wants to reach out and expand, have adventures, wants to believe that that is the missing piece to reduce the pain condition and other countries could come close to healing me and that not opting for this the more and more, day by day disappearing chance to work&amp;travel is me giving up wanting to broaden my world and simply be out there - which feels like a certain loss too.  \nComing close to actually buying the pc spare parts makes me freeze and feel horrible, putting that aside and deciding to go and continue the steps for work&amp;travel does the same and rises a different fear as well as overhwelm. I do not know if this is also a depression problem with it being decision fatigue perhaps, simply the impossibility to choose one thing for certain because deciding for one feels completely fatal.  \nTl;dr: starting to believe I am losing my mind. The instant I am close to buying pc spare parts or improving other areas of my living space I freeze and cannot do it and feel disgust and then do not but keep thinking that abroad travel and work is better, the next day I am back to step one. + I lose so much time going back and forth on this but am unable to make a clear decision that feels just right.",

But life has been pretty overwhelming lately, and I guess I've been lapsing more...\n\nLast night I made everyone's favorite soup for dinner. Husband and kids helped clean up, but he had to do his timesheet so he asked me what else needed to be done... tired and occupied (feeding the pup, and her food is a bit complicated), I shrugged and \"whatever, it's fine\". Well it wasn't fine, I just have decision fatigue. Then, kids are playing with the puppy in the livingroom while I wipe the counters, start the dishwasher and am finishing cleaning the kitchen (this is a low-level trigger for me\\*), when husband comes in to say he's going up to shower and go to bed. I ask if he was going to put the soup away, he asks if I can do it later after it has cooled (since I was going to be up working late anyway) and I snap \"I\u2019ve been cleaning up for the past 20 minutes after I made dinner\u2026\u201d , he said \u201cI\u2019ll just do it now\u201d , my stepdaughter says  \u201cwhy can\u2019t it be put away now?\u201d, and so he just put the soup away and went up to bed. I could tell he wasn\u2019t happy. (I don't know how the kids felt at that moment tbh).\n\n\\*The kids are teenagers (14 &amp; 16) and are about the age I was when things were getting really bad for me at home. By 13, my dad had brainwashed me against my mother, taken us to a different country with his younger girlfriend, and I was the Cinderella of the family. I never got to relax, I didn\u2019t get to sit with the family and watch movies (my brother did), no, I was in the kitchen cleaning, or doing some other chores, or doing my homework because I would get a beating if I didn\u2019t get straight As, or doing my dad\u2019s graduate homework even. And that wasn\u2019t even the worse part.. that was just the everyday bullshit - that was my \"normal\".\n\nAnyway, so we have both been working from home since March now\u2026 And we are both super busy with work. He\u2019s on meetings most of the day, I spend all day working and barely even get to touch my own projects. Work has been stressful for both of us. He was distant and processing all day, and at dinner he basically tells me that this isn't working, mainly because these tense moments only happen when the kids are around.  He said he sees that I\u2019m not happy (lately I\u2019ve really been struggling, but haven\u2019t we ALL?) and that he wants me to be happy and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to me to put me through this if it\u2019s so painful. He thinks I would be happier without them.\n\nI feel like such a failure right now. I thought I was doing so good. It felt healthy and good. And now the rug has been pulled out and I feel broken and I feel like these wounds will never fucking heal. I feel like I will be a prisoner to this hell for the rest of my life and I will never be free and happy.\n\nEdit: To be clear, this was not an isolated incident, but part of a pattern. As I said in a comment below, I have an overwhelm cycle where I pile things on myself and then eventually burn out and breakdown (and blame him for something in the  process), and then I guess this similar cycle where my envy for his kids  and their relationship with their parents builds and something gives. I  confessed to him that I am jealous, particularly of his daughter. And it's probably not for the reasons he thinks, but for basic things like  that they are loved unconditionally for who they are, that they don't  need to feel like they have to prove themselves, that they can speak  their minds without fear, and are allowed to relax and enjoy themselves. I want these things for myself, and I know it's up to me now, but I  still struggle with this. I try to recognize my behaviors, I meditate, I try to give myself space when I need it and give the kids space, and I don't feel like I am harming them or making them uncomfortable. Most of the time it's great, sometimes I am probably distant and seem cold, and I bury myself in work to cope.  I do apologize and let them know that it's not them but something I am going through (without details, I don't know how to talk to kids about this and I don't want to burden them with my issues, I don't think that's fair).

Sometimes I have some extra to splurge on things that I know that I\u2019ve been wanting and that would be a well-spent investment. \n\nWhen I have money for any of those things, sometimes I just don\u2019t know what to do with it. I\u2019m filled with an overt decision fatigue or I feel kind of guilty about buying them. I\u2019ve been needing a lunchbox with optimized space, and I got a rather cool bento box recently to take lunch on-the-go with me. It was both a want *and* a need, but I\u2019m somehow left feeling like that purchase was a bad choice or that I should have never wanted it to begin with. \n\nSide note: I grew up with a parent that got suspicious of me having my own money and not asking her to get what I wanted/needed; often having something negative to say when I got something new or nice for myself (even if it was thrifted \u2014 which I spent most of my life doing!), so I learned to hide when I had earned money and most of the things I bought for myself. I\u2019d usually send any packages I had to my grandparents\u2019 house. It\u2019s no wonder I struggle with this.\n\n\nAnybody else ever dealt with this?",

Sometimes I have some extra to splurge on things that I know that I\u2019ve been wanting and that would be a well-spent investment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I have money for any of those things, sometimes I just don\u2019t know what to do with it. I\u2019m filled with an overt decision fatigue or I feel kind of guilty about buying them. I\u2019ve been needing a lunchbox with optimized space, and I got a rather cool bento box recently to take lunch on-the-go with me. It was both a want &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a need, but I\u2019m somehow left feeling like that purchase was a bad choice or that I should have never wanted it to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note: I grew up with a parent that got suspicious of me having my own money and not asking her to get what I wanted/needed; often having something negative to say when I got something new or nice for myself (even if it was thrifted \u2014 which I spent most of my life doing!), so I learned to hide when I had earned money and most of the things I bought for myself. I\u2019d usually send any packages I had to my grandparents\u2019 house. It\u2019s no wonder I struggle with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anybody else ever dealt with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
