I watch a lot of YouTube on different apps and methods and I always want to try something new, download a new app etc. The problem is that I can never actually get organized because I keep on setting up a new system in a new app to try out. It\u2019s making me anxious and my OCD makes me stressed over the amount of apps i have on my computer (I have an inner dialogue that tells me that all my apps need to be fully used and organized and I can\u2019t have too many apps). \n\nIf anyone has experienced this, especially when new apps are constantly emerging, how do you deal with it? And how do you find a method that works for you without constantly being tempted by something new or by the promise of something life changing?",

I watch a lot of YouTube on different apps and methods and I always want to try something new, download a new app etc. The problem is that I can never actually get organized because I keep on setting up a new system in a new app to try out. It\u2019s making me anxious and my OCD makes me stressed over the amount of apps i have on my computer (I have an inner dialogue that tells me that all my apps need to be fully used and organized and I can\u2019t have too many apps). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has experienced this, especially when new apps are constantly emerging, how do you deal with it? And how do you find a method that works for you without constantly being tempted by something new or by the promise of something life changing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

For example, I have a morning/night routine that's pretty much on autopilot. I am ready to go to bed in 5-10 minutes regardless of what I'm doing at the moment, and I'm ready to get out the house in 5-10 minutes as well (assuming I don't eat breakfast). This reduces decision fatigue, which I've learned can really wear you down mentally if you're constantly thinking of what choice to make next in your day.\n\nAlso, having a consistent breakfast is helpful. At the moment, I still have a lot of leftover food in my pantry that I'll slowly eat over the next week, but once it's empty this will be my breakfast: a cup of oats with a dash of cinnamon and a frozen banana, along with two fried eggs with a tall glass of water on the side. Simple, takes 5 minutes to make, is nutritious and cheap. Autopilot.\n\nThis extends to my exercise regimen as well. Many people stress themselves out because they don't set consistent days to workout, so it becomes a test of willpower whenever they feel that they should go to the gym. If you set particular and reasonable times to go (reasonable in the sense that you won't burn out with the frequency and it works well with your schedule), you'll be consistent with your fitness. Lifting 3x/week for 1 hour each session works best for me.\n\nASIDE: Get into doing compound movements (squat/bench/deadlift/overhead press/row/chin-up) and don't waste your time doing mindless cardio on a treadmill. It's far better for body composition regardless of what fitness level you're at, and it's far more effective at burning body fat and building healthy muscle. I've found that a lot of women are scared of \"getting bulky\", but realize that the bulky women you see are jacked on steroids and eating insane amounts.\n\nSame with finding time to study. I like to be productive in the evening, where I can get work consistently done. Make sure to give yourself mental breaks once in a while, stay hydrated, and don't listen to music in your language (I like classical while studying, or just plugging earphones in my ears to block outside noise).\n\nSlowly but surely, your brain will begin to associate certain times of the day with certain tasks. That's when you know you've developed a habit. Develop routines for things you need to do daily, and save your decision making energy for more spontaneous events that occur in life.",

For a long time, I used to put off important tasks because I didn't have a clear idea of what I should be doing.\n\nFor example, I'd tell myself things like \"I want to exercise more\" or \"I want to be more productive\" The problem was that these sentences were extremely vague and they weren't specific enough. So guess what? I didn't take action.\n\nYou need to make the activity so specific that you ALWAYS know what to do. For example, if you find yourself saying \"I want to exercise more\" or \"I want to get in better shape\" You should instead, tell yourself \"I want to start going to the gym at 5pm EVERY DAY and hitting X workout routine\" \n\nHaving a specific plan already in place and considering every single variable will reduce decision fatigue and make the activity feel a lot easier to do overall. \n\nSo if you keep putting off important activities, maybe it's because your plans aren't detailed enough.",

And it allows you to create new tags very easily, which encourages over-optimization.\n\n## **Discourage creative people**\n\nFinally, he says that seeing very complex label systems can discourage creative people who could benefit from a system like PARA, giving them the false impression that meticulous advance planning is necessary.\n\n## **Discussion on the use of tags in PARA**\n\nAs a user of the PARA system, I wanted to open a discussion on whether you think adding multiple additional tags to PARA elements (in addition to the inherent categorization into Projects/Areas/Resources/Files) is really useful or necessary.\n\nAccording to Forte, keeping the system as simple as possible in terms of additional labels would be ideal to reduce cognitive friction. I'm interested to know what you think about this or what the best practices are for this with tags in PARA.\n\n## **My experience with tags**\n\nPersonally, I have tried tags, such as health, money.. making it too complicated or notes that can have 2 or more tags. Also with simpler ones like high priority and low priority, but really for storing notes, I don't see much point in priority.\n\n### Do you use extra tags in PARA or not?\n\nI am adopting your methodology and using the system without any extra tags, it is very strange for me but I am also relieved to think that I do not need a complex system of tags.\n\n*Forte recommends tagging excessively large collections of notes.",

And it allows you to create new tags very easily, which encourages over-optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discourage creative people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, he says that seeing very complex label systems can discourage creative people who could benefit from a system like PARA, giving them the false impression that meticulous advance planning is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion on the use of tags in PARA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a user of the PARA system, I wanted to open a discussion on whether you think adding multiple additional tags to PARA elements (in addition to the inherent categorization into Projects/Areas/Resources/Files) is really useful or necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Forte, keeping the system as simple as possible in terms of additional labels would be ideal to reduce cognitive friction. I&amp;#39;m interested to know what you think about this or what the best practices are for this with tags in PARA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My experience with tags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have tried tags, such as health, money.. making it too complicated or notes that can have 2 or more tags. Also with simpler ones like high priority and low priority, but really for storing notes, I don&amp;#39;t see much point in priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Do you use extra tags in PARA or not?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am adopting your methodology and using the system without any extra tags, it is very strange for me but I am also relieved to think that I do not need a complex system of tags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Forte recommends tagging excessively large collections of notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I sure do!\n\nFor example, two months ago, I went on a spree and signed up for 25 email newsletters. Why? Because I wanted to stay up-to-date with the latest ideas in productivity and self-improvement.\n\nEvery morning, my email inbox overflowed with daily tips, tricks, and hacks to make me unstoppable. The best information from the biggest names in productivity.\n\nBut did I read them? NOPE. Did I discover amazing secrets, conquer my procrastination, achieve greater productivity, and become superhuman? Definitely not.\n\nIn fact, I just invented work for myself. Every morning I was faced with a dozen emails to make decisions about. Do I read it now? (No, there's no time.) Do I skim section headers and bolded bits for nuggets of wisdom? (Sure, that won't take long.) Do I flag it for future reading? (Yeah, \"future me\" will definitely read it.)\n\nBut \"future me\" never showed up. (If I'm honest, he's pretty unreliable. He talks a good game but never shows up when I need him.)\n\nThe flagged emails stacked up, and as of yesterday, there were 909 of them. 909 cases of \"I'll read this later.\" 909 mini obligations. 909 dropped balls. 909 tiny reasons I'm not living up to my ideal self.\n\nSo yesterday came four big realizations:\n\n* I believed \"future me\" would read the 909 flagged emails, but deep down, I didn't want to. I didn't lack time; I lacked motivation.\n* Skimming emails was a waste of time, especially as I got sucked down some random rabbit hole (yesterday, I got distracted by self-determination theory).\n* Making decisions about a bunch of emails every morning increased my decision fatigue.\n* The mountain of flagged emails kept growing, making me feel bad about myself.\n\nThe path was clear: Unsubscribe from everything that's not providing immediate value.\n\nBut how do I measure a newsletter's value? Honestly, I have no idea, so instead, I assigned each email a cost. I imagined each costing me $1 worth of attention.\n\nThen, I went through my emails, one by one, and asked, \"Would I pay $1 to receive this?\" In nearly every case, my answer was a resounding no.\n\nYesterday, I unsubscribed from 23 email newsletters. And I felt relief because my future self would have fewer self-imposed obligations.\n\nNext, I imagined each flagged email costing me $1/month. Then, I spent an hour unflagging emails. I still have 359 of them (way higher than my ideal), but progress is progress, right? On Saturday, I plan to unflag another 100 emails, freeing myself of more mini obligations.\n\nWhen I checked my email this morning, I had fewer messages to sort through. Fewer decisions to make. Fewer emails to flag, and secretly wonder if I've ever read. And I felt relieved.\n\nSo here's my advice to you: Imagine each email in your inbox costs $1 of attention. What should you unsubscribe from? What should you mark spam?\n\nBe ruthless. Ensure that advertisers and newsletters don't devour your attention. Because they will if you allow them.",

I\u2019m notoriously inefficient and easily distracted. Time seems like grains of sand that slip through my hands. So I\u2019m determined to be disciplined with my time. Here are techniques that I have used to use my time better. These are a little complicated though. What are underrated but effective techniques for you?\n\n1. Use an app to track all your time. I\u2019m be shocked at how long everything takes. Having this information helps me better plan to use my time well. I use the Hours app on IOS. \n2. Set a timer for each task and work on only that task until the timer is up. I\u2019m shocked at how much more effective and focused I am when I do this. Consequently, I produce much better quality work. This is important for me as a lawyer who does mentally strenuous work. \n2. Use my calendar as my to do list so I have a realistic plan to get things done. This helps because I\u2019m notoriously delusional about how long everything will take so having a rough estimate keeps me grounded and better able to execute. \n3. Put all my reoccurring chores and tasks in my calendar. I.e., I usually block off time for my morning routine, evening routine, lunch, laundry, journaling, grocery run, errands, etc. Everything that I do at least once a week has a reoccurring time assigned to it in my calendar. This helps me plan more effectively for the week and get everything done and there\u2019s much less decision fatigue about what I need to get done and when. \n4. Set goals and plan larger goals in 30 or 90 day windows. Set goals for each month and each quarter and then make a realistic daily and weekly plan to conquer these goals. This is a long enough period to tackle bigger projects but short enough to create realistic deadlines. \n5. Keep a list of priority tasks for the day, week, and month in a visible location to remind myself of what I am working towards. I physically rewrite the daily priorities so I know what I should be working and when. \n6. Time block the next day the night before at least hour by hour. I fill out tomorrow\u2019s calendar hour by hour with a rough plan of what I\u2019ll do and when. I fill out my day in Apple calendar and I\u2019m shocked at how this plan and the calendar alarm keeps me on track. I notoriously get distracted so the plan is helpful to keep me on track. Tasks are broken down into at least hour chunks so I can use each hour efficiently.\n7. Limit distractions. I remove distracting apps from my phone, turn off my phone when I work, and sequester myself in a quiet room or use noise canceling headphones if I can\u2019t find a quiet space. This helps me focus and work more efficiently and produce better quality work.\n8. Build quiet time into my calendar daily and weekly to reflect, strategize, and plan so I can keep myself accountable to my goals and plan my actions strategically. Direction is more important than speed so choosing my priorities wisely is half the battle. Quiet time helps me plan effectively. \n9. Get some sleep! I\u2019m much more effective, smarter, and productive if I\u2019m well rested. \n10. Make eating healthy and working out as easy as possible. I invest in my health daily for long term gains and make it easy so I\u2019ll do it. I.e., have salads or grab and go meals around, plan my workouts, and workout first thing or else I won\u2019t have the will power to do it.",

What are underrated but effective techniques for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use an app to track all your time. I\u2019m be shocked at how long everything takes. Having this information helps me better plan to use my time well. I use the Hours app on IOS. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for each task and work on only that task until the timer is up. I\u2019m shocked at how much more effective and focused I am when I do this. Consequently, I produce much better quality work. This is important for me as a lawyer who does mentally strenuous work. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use my calendar as my to do list so I have a realistic plan to get things done. This helps because I\u2019m notoriously delusional about how long everything will take so having a rough estimate keeps me grounded and better able to execute. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Put all my reoccurring chores and tasks in my calendar. I.e., I usually block off time for my morning routine, evening routine, lunch, laundry, journaling, grocery run, errands, etc. Everything that I do at least once a week has a reoccurring time assigned to it in my calendar. This helps me plan more effectively for the week and get everything done and there\u2019s much less decision fatigue about what I need to get done and when. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set goals and plan larger goals in 30 or 90 day windows. Set goals for each month and each quarter and then make a realistic daily and weekly plan to conquer these goals. This is a long enough period to tackle bigger projects but short enough to create realistic deadlines. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep a list of priority tasks for the day, week, and month in a visible location to remind myself of what I am working towards. I physically rewrite the daily priorities so I know what I should be working and when. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Time block the next day the night before at least hour by hour. I fill out tomorrow\u2019s calendar hour by hour with a rough plan of what I\u2019ll do and when. I fill out my day in Apple calendar and I\u2019m shocked at how this plan and the calendar alarm keeps me on track. I notoriously get distracted so the plan is helpful to keep me on track. Tasks are broken down into at least hour chunks so I can use each hour efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Limit distractions. I remove distracting apps from my phone, turn off my phone when I work, and sequester myself in a quiet room or use noise canceling headphones if I can\u2019t find a quiet space. This helps me focus and work more efficiently and produce better quality work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build quiet time into my calendar daily and weekly to reflect, strategize, and plan so I can keep myself accountable to my goals and plan my actions strategically. Direction is more important than speed so choosing my priorities wisely is half the battle. Quiet time helps me plan effectively. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get some sleep! I\u2019m much more effective, smarter, and productive if I\u2019m well rested. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make eating healthy and working out as easy as possible. I invest in my health daily for long term gains and make it easy so I\u2019ll do it. I.e., have salads or grab and go meals around, plan my workouts, and workout first thing or else I won\u2019t have the will power to do it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Epictetus told us that **Men are disturbed not by things themselves** but **the view which they take of them**.\n\nOur identities and the way we constantly re-frame ourselves essentially shapes our behaviour and experiences.\n\nPeople often underestimate the way words directly impact actions. \n\n**Bad habits weigh us down on our journey to moral excellence**; like an anchor, they can pull us back. It's our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. \n\nThis identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d \n\nA study published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.\n\nThere were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase **\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d** both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. \n\nAs the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). \n\nThe researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. \n\n39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. \n\nThe idea is then that **one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.**\n\nWe can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. \n\n#Decision fatigue\n\nWe like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.\n\nVeganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).\n\nSome people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. \n\n**Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.**\n\nIn studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).\n\nThere\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. \n\nThis means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates\n\n#Don\u2019t count days. \n\nAnother idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. \n\n**NEVER count days.** Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a \"smoker who went 40 days without it\" or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d\n\n**Every habit is triggered by some event.** For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. \n\nI found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. \n\nThen I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. \n\nThis helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.\n\nThe point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. \n\nTaken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9\n\n#[Watch This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;t)\n\n**Sources:**\n\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions\n\n(1) http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full",

It&amp;#39;s our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt; tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase &lt;strong&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is then that &lt;strong&gt;one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Decision fatigue&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Veganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Don\u2019t count days.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER count days.&lt;/strong&gt; Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a &amp;quot;smoker who went 40 days without it&amp;quot; or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every habit is triggered by some event.&lt;/strong&gt; For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;amp;t\"&gt;Watch This Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Extraneous factors in judicial decisions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full\"&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but either way need some way to solve this for longer than a day. My main issue is decision fatigue, and I lose focus and get anxious quickly if I have to stop in the middle of the day to wonder what the next most important task is only to find a disorganized list of 50 things, usually all of which were due 2 weeks ago (my job is a lot).\n\nI have tried so many systems (paper planners, google calendar, ToDoist, Asana, Excel, phone notes, excessive Outlook calendaring etc) but none of them seems to strike the right balance. Paper planners and calendaring help a lot, but I get anxious if it's not tied to a full and complete list of everything I want or need to do. And systems like Todoist are great but don't really adequately help prioritize between tasks and projects. At work I've been using Asana, but it has no automatic mechanism for recurring tasks. \n\nPlease tell me how y'all do it. Nothing seems to last. I can't keep spending time building new systems just to let my brain breathe only to have them fall apart in week one.\n\nIf you could recommend ONE tool or system, which one would it be?",

I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD but either way need some way to solve this for longer than a day. My main issue is decision fatigue, and I lose focus and get anxious quickly if I have to stop in the middle of the day to wonder what the next most important task is only to find a disorganized list of 50 things, usually all of which were due 2 weeks ago (my job is a lot).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried so many systems (paper planners, google calendar, ToDoist, Asana, Excel, phone notes, excessive Outlook calendaring etc) but none of them seems to strike the right balance. Paper planners and calendaring help a lot, but I get anxious if it&amp;#39;s not tied to a full and complete list of everything I want or need to do. And systems like Todoist are great but don&amp;#39;t really adequately help prioritize between tasks and projects. At work I&amp;#39;ve been using Asana, but it has no automatic mechanism for recurring tasks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please tell me how y&amp;#39;all do it. Nothing seems to last. I can&amp;#39;t keep spending time building new systems just to let my brain breathe only to have them fall apart in week one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could recommend ONE tool or system, which one would it be?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d**\n- Barack Obama\n\nAlbert Einstein famously wore the same simple outfits everyday for these exact reasons.\n\nThe less decisions you make, the more decisive you will be. By limiting your decisions you can **move into action more fluidly** and use better judgement when making tough choices.\n\nHowever, now a days there are so many **social media applications that force decision making,** such as Tinder or Instagram (in choosing what to like or engage with) and they **deplete decision making resources.**\n\n**I'm not saying you should adopt a monotonous clothing selection or \npreselect your meals, instead just be conscious how you are using your decision-making battery.**\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roatk4tP1NM) will specifically examine Tinder,  as it reveals how using our decision making resources on social media applications has major consequences. I hope it helps improve decision making and your increase energy - so you can have a more productive day.\n\n",

If you haven&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s about time that you did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, on any given day we have a limited amount of decision making energy - a battery, so to say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more decisions we make, the more we drain that battery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Countless successful people limit the number of decisions they make a day in order to reduce decision fatigue and be more productive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs and Christopher Nolan have ALL gone on record saying they limit the number of decisions they make in a day - by either having clothes and/or food pre-selected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a waste of energy to choose anew what to wear each day.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Christopher Nolan &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein famously wore the same simple outfits everyday for these exact reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The less decisions you make, the more decisive you will be. By limiting your decisions you can &lt;strong&gt;move into action more fluidly&lt;/strong&gt; and use better judgement when making tough choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, now a days there are so many &lt;strong&gt;social media applications that force decision making,&lt;/strong&gt; such as Tinder or Instagram (in choosing what to like or engage with) and they &lt;strong&gt;deplete decision making resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying you should adopt a monotonous clothing selection or \npreselect your meals, instead just be conscious how you are using your decision-making battery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roatk4tP1NM\"&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; will specifically examine Tinder,  as it reveals how using our decision making resources on social media applications has major consequences. I hope it helps improve decision making and your increase energy - so you can have a more productive day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Or when I don't accomplish everything I set out to do.\n\nAfter continuously making tweaks over the years (and continuing to), I've been able to minimize the feeling of dissatisfaction and create Ideal Weeks with greater frequency. Last year I had 12. I already have 3 this year.\n\nAnd it hasn't been guesswork. I've studied the best practices and literature, from David Allen's GTD, Bullet Journal, The Artist's Way, to Stephen Covey and Darren Hardy...you name it.\n\nI learned that **it's not about productivity \"hacks.\"**\n\nAt its core, it's a simple loop of reflection, assessment, and planning which helps me:\n\n* **Learn** from what worked and what didn't \n* **Acknowledge** and appreciate the work done\n* **Be accountable**\n* **Get closure** and start fresh\n* Create a sense of **excitement**\n* **Build momentum**\n\nHere you will find the backbone of that weekly planning process, and no, it is not a \"definitive\" guide. It is a reference and a starting point, which I hope you find useful. Try it and make it your own.\n\n## Step 1: Grounding\n\nThe first and most crucial step is grounding yourself. This is a practice of checking in with yourself, thinking about your Future Self, your core values, and then reviewing your personal and company goals. This is your moment to **step back, remind yourself why you are here, where you are going and recalibrate your lens** so that you can lead the rest of the Weekly Review ritual with the right intention.\n\n## Step 2: Weekly Retrospective\n\nThe next step is looking backward. It\u2019s essential to take the time, review the key moments that happened so that you can reflect on them were. It\u2019s easy to forget things as they happen to us, and **by being a bystander to our own lives, we lose the opportunity to grow**. That\u2019s why we need to take some time for reflection. Here are some of the key questions that you can ask yourself to reflect on the previous week:\n\n* What happened this week?\n* Where did I spend the time that wasn\u2019t for my highest good?\n* What was my biggest win?\n* What was my biggest lesson learned?\n* What\u2019s my takeaway from the last three questions, and how can I leverage it moving forward?\n* Who had the greatest influence on me this week? How did they influence me?\n* What am I most grateful for this week?\n\n## Step 3: Goals Review\n\n**Review your list of personal and company goals**. How are you doing on each one? Identify those that are more important and need attention. Then explore them one by one, **capturing what can be done this week to move the needle** and progress them. You can capture these to-dos (we call them Pyns) on your productivity tool of choice, be it a piece of paper, a planner, or an online platform.\n\n## Step 4: Check your inbox and calendar\n\nWe all know that what happens in our inbox and calendar influences what we work on and how we spend our time, as described by [Des Traynor\u2019s tweet](https://twitter.com/destraynor/status/1143853719135621121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1143853719135621121%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdestraynor%2Fstatus%2F1143853719135621121). By proactively taking charge of that, we can stay ahead of the curve and minimize surprises. Take some time to review your email inbox (or inboxes) and calendar, look for **emails that require your action**, and **identify meetings, appointments, or events that require preparation** or can affect your time. Again, **capture what needs to get done this week** for each item and add it to your list.\n\n## Step 5: Check your master list\n\nYou know that *list or note* *where you dump everything you don\u2019t want to forget?* That\u2019s your **master list.** (if you don\u2019t have one, you should start one).\n\nTake the next little bit and review your master list and scan for anything that you need to get done this week or if you have an extra opening for something you want to do in your personal life and don\u2019t usually get the chance to. Add the relevant items to your list.\n\n## Step 6: Review, prioritize, and time block\n\nGetting closer to the finish line. What you have created so far is a weekly to-do list aligned with your personal and company goals, taking into account what is coming your way, so nothing falls through the cracks, and allows you to be proactive.\n\nYou may have some of this information already, but go through each item again and do the following three things for each item:\n\n1. **Due Date;** Is there a due date for this item, or do I want to get it done by a specific date? Define the level of urgency.\n2. **Priority;** How important is it? Define the level of priority and importance for each item. I like having three levels of priority (and one ultimate priority): *Normal* (no priority), *Low*, *High*, and *Most Important Things* (LynchPyn priority)\n3. **Time Blocking;** Is it an important item (a LynchPyn priority usually) that absolutely needs to get done, and you want to make sure you allocate sufficient time to get it done? Then schedule time dedicated to the item and time block.\n\nAfter adding the three attributes to each item, take the time to sort your list. I personally prefer sorting by due date and priority to look at the most urgent AND important things first which many refer to as Most Important Tasks or MIT (AKA what has to get done first).\n\n## Step 7: Daily Planning\n\nThe final step to conclude your weekly planning is to plan for Monday (or whatever your first day of the week is). With the work you\u2019ve done already, this is extremely easy and will be equally as easy for the rest of the week because you\u2019ve adequately prepared yourself for the upcoming week. Look at your weekly list once more and ask yourself the following:\n\nWhat are the three things that need to get done and will create the highest impact?\n\nThey most likely are the first three items in your already sorted list. Move those three items over to your Today\u2019s list. Using the rule of 3 (similar to the [Ivy Lee method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee)), you remove any distractions so you can do deep work, reduce \u201cdecision fatigue,\u201d and force yourself to become focused on the right priorities.\n\n# Wrapping up\n\nI know this may seem a lot but as with anything in life you get what you put into it. This process has created so much value for me in the last few years and **I want to invite you to schedule a dedicated time (even 15\u201320 minutes) and give this template a try.** ***Make it your own.*** The most important thing is to have a structured weekly routine that helps you reflect and plan in alignment with your goals.\n\nHaving a weekly routine of reflection and planning will sharpen your focus, save you time throughout the week, and helps you move the needle on your goals. And by getting in this rhythm, you give yourself the opportunity to reset, recalibrate, and start fresh each week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think. Are you using a process already? Do you use different questions for your weekly retro? I'm always eager to learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

And it's sucking your energy.\n\n&gt;[Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) \u2014 In decision making and psychology, decision fatigue refers  to the deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a  long session of decision making.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is now  understood as one of the causes of irrational trade-offs in decision  making. Research has shown that we only have the capacity to make so  many sound decisions in a day, because making decisions is exhausting.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Notably,  major politicians and businessmen such as former United States  President Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg have been known  to reduce their everyday clothing down to one or two outfits in order to  limit the number of decisions they make in a day.\n\nSo recently I got this idea that it might be pretty cool if I compile  a list of errands and actions that I periodically do in my life. Then,  set up some system to be constantly reminded at the right time and date  about my stuff. Now, I **don't need to think about when I should do something** and I also **never forget** that **I\u00a0have should done something.**  This ranges from boring assignments like cleaning out a refrigerator to  performing something healthy like signing up for a massage, dentist or  whatever.\n\n## How does it work\n\n1. Come up with a list of actions which you perform or want to perform on a somewhat consistent basis;\n\n2. Write that down into your task manager;\n\n3.  Setup an automated recurring timeframe for every task depending on your  preferences (I have daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, yearly and 2-3  yearly recurrences)\n\nCongrats on making your life more organized now.\n\n## What tool am I using as my task manager?\n\n[Things 3.](https://culturedcode.com/things/)\n\nIt's just beautiful. A nice alternative I used for a while before things: [Any.do](https://www.any.do/),  especially if you're not on a MacOS/IOS ecosystem, since Things is  exclusive to the Apple ecosystem. While Things is a pretty decent piece  of a software, it's a bit lacking in advanced features, like doing some  math with dates and numbers.\n\nSo to track my subscriptions I'm using [Clickup.](https://clickup.com/)  I\u00a0use it very wildly and extensively for my business as a central  virtual hub for everything \u2014 from CRM\u00a0platform to marketing and  financial tracking and planning. And now,\u00a0I use it to track my  subscriptions. I'm still setting this up and trying to remember to what  else I an subscribed, but one interesting insight I want to share with  you is that it might make sense to consider basically every purchase as  something temporary aka a \"subscription\".\n\nFor example your phone.  And pillow. Footwear, etc. Then, calculate the expected life of those  goods. If, for example, you bought your phone in 2019 and you expect it  to last you 3 years, get that data into the 2022 list. This way you can  have kind of a visible financial plan for each year. It's handy and  helps you to plan better. This strategy also helps me to indulge myself  into buying fancy stuff when I really feel like it \ud83d\ude0f\n\nYou know,  there is one way of thinking when you buy a $2000 piece of tech at once,  but when you expect it to last, let's say 3 years, then you pay only  $1.80 a day for that, which makes it OK to be considered.\n\n## What recurrences do I\u00a0have?\n\nAs I'm only a few months into  this system I'm still setting it up/adding new stuff every month. So  far, I've tracked the next chapters of my life with it:\n\n**Home management**\n\n* from cleaning and maintaining specific stuff in our apartment, to restocking our \"warehouse\" \n\n(just making sure that we have enough toilet paper, toothpaste, cleaning detergents, etc.)\n\n**Business management**\n\n* routines like approaching leads, checking if everyone is happy, reviewing our strategy, website, long-term goals, etc.\n\n**Health management**\n\n* activity every day, dentist check every 6 months, ordering contact lenses every 4 months, massage and haircut every month, etc.\n\n**Brains, productivity and self-reflection**\n\n* studying,  planning the next day, performing backups, learning new features from  the software that I use, recording a summary video to myself in the  future on every December 31, etc.\n\n## Unexpected bonuses\n\nOur  apartment became so much cleaner! Before, it might have taken a good  half of the day to do kind of \u00a0\"general\" cleaning. Now, we might do one  small thing every couple of days and because of this, our home stays  super clean and we don't forget about very specific errands, like  cleaning out that ventilation grid in the bathroom, or cleaning out  behind the furnishings. I have more energy since now I don't have to  keep tons of decisions about various errands in my head and it's a very  nice feeling to check off each daily chore once it's completed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope it was interesting.\n\nIf you use a similar automation in your workflow, would love to read what recurrences you have.",

Podcasts, audiobooks, books, articles, etc. I collect knowledge perpetually, constantly on the hunt for the perfect system that will clear the storm of thoughts and emotions endlessly swirling around inside my head, distracting me from what needs to be done.\n\nI never stick to a system for more than a few days or a week or two at the most. I feel a little better and more organized for a bit, and then the distractions, the decision fatigue, the self-doubt all start to creep in.\n\nInevitably I determine that my most recent half-assed attempt at implementing the shiny new productivity system is the culprit, and I continue my search for the Holy Grail of productivity.\n\nLogically, writing about it and examining it from as neutral a position as I can, I know this isn\u2019t going to work. But what is it fundamentally that\u2019s causing this internal angst and why do I turn to find the perfect productivity system as a solution?\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking on this in the recent weeks and months and thought I would write up those thoughts here both to help anyone struggling with the same issues and to clarify my own thinking.\n\nI believe that we run to productivity as a sort of addiction when we have deeper issues going on internally. I have recently felt scattered and overwhelmed with the amount of work I feel that I need to get done along with some stuff going on in my personal life. This has manifested itself with pretty constant anxiety that seems to come specifically in the form of being anxious about not getting enough done or not working on the right things.\n\nI started obsessively researching productivity systems and hacks in order to try to get a handle on how much I had to get done. But it never seemed to help.\n\nPart of the problem is obvious: I never stuck to one long enough to get used to it. But there was something else going on.\n\nThe system technically did what it was supposed to do. It was helping me keep track of my schedule and get done what I needed to.\n\nBut the mental mess didn\u2019t go away.\n\nI realized I was using productivity as a band-aid to try and fix some internal mental struggles I was going through.\n\nSo instead of jumping to another productivity system, I decided to focus on improving myself.\n\nRight now I\u2019m doing this very simply, by taking three actions every morning when I wake up.\n\n* Move\n* Write\n* Do\n\n\"Move\" is a 45-minute workout. I ruck up a hill outside my house with a 20 lb steel plate. But it can be whatever you want, just 45 minutes of strenuous exercise.\n\n\"Write\" is journaling. But journaling with the express purpose of pruning my mind. I have no goal other than to dump my brain out onto the page. I\u2019ve found that just getting my thoughts out of my head and into the world dramatically helps me process them and let them go, depending on how useful they are.\n\nI've tried journaling a few times because I've heard of the benefits over and over again. But it always felt forced because it was just another thing I was adding into my routine because other people said to do it.\n\nOnce I started journaling with a specific purpose that was helpful for me, just getting thoughts out of my head to make some room up there, it felt great.\n\nWith those two things done, I\u2019m in a much better spot to do. The \u201cDo\u201d step is simple but difficult. It involves choosing the task on my list that I most dread doing, and then doing it.\n\nI realize this is easier said than done, but at some point, we have to just do uncomfortable things that we don't want to do. It's the only way to grow and our internal compass is more accurate than we think at telling us what we need to work on.\n\nThe problem is that the compass points desperately away from the thing we have to do, so we get distracted. We should lean into that feeling and take it as a pointer toward what we need to do.\n\nIf that thing is large and intimidating, break it down until you get to one actionable thing you can do right now.\n\nOnce I\u2019ve done these three things, I tend to have a much more productive and peaceful day than if I don\u2019t do them.\n\nAt a deeper level though, I am developing my discipline and self-confidence by committing to taking certain actions every day and then sticking with them and actually getting important things done.\n\nJust as others\u2019 confidence in you grows as your actions align with your words, so does your self-confidence for the same reason.\n\nThis so far has been the most effective thing I have tried in my search for peace and productivity.\n\nIt has made a big difference not only in my external productivity my in my internal peace and sense of stillness.\n\nHopefully, it helps someone struggling with the same challenges.",

[Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).\n\nThinking, Fast and Slow introduced me to the world of clear thinking, decision-making, and mental models. It\u2019s worth a proper read (vs. skimming or reading a summary).\n\n**The TL;DR is that we rely on two systems of thinking:**\n\n* **System 1 (Thinking Fast)** is the intuitive, subconscious \u201cgut response\u201d way of thinking and decision making. It\u2019s always-on and gives us the ability to create fast impressions, judgements, and intuition.\n* **System 2 (Thinking Slow)** is the analytical, logical, intentional way of decision making. It\u2019s used for reflection, analysis, and problem solving.\u00a0\n\nMost of the time, we engage System 1. Which may lead to biased decision making and poorer choices. It\u2019s also easier to use System 1 as it requires much less cognitive effort.\n\n**We have a limited amount of daily cognitive power to use.** Each decision we make taxes our brain and the quality of our decisions begins to erode over the course of a typical day.\n\n* Steve Jobs famously wore the same outfit every day so he never had to think about what to wear.\n* Barack Obama replies to his low priority emails to \"Agree, \"Disagree\" or \"Discuss\" to simplify his workflow.\n\n**Decision fatigue is real and as we consume our mental resources, we subconsciously rely on passive heuristics (mental shortcuts) to make decisions**. That's why it's important to regularly sharpen our mental models.\n\nAcknowledging the cognitive biases that affect our thinking allows us to stay rational. It only takes a second to ask ourselves \"What am I missing here?\" or \"What irrational factors may be influencing my judgement?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are 8 cognitive biases you should know about:**\n\n### \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Confirmation Bias\n\n**People are prone to believe what they want to believe.** Confirmation bias is the tendency to subconsciously seek information to validate existing beliefs.\u00a0\n\nIf you've got a hunch that a company's stock will be successful, you may only look for supporting arguments during your Google search. If you think social media companies are evil, you may be subconsciously biased in the way you frame your questions, \"How evil are social media companies?\". If you believe that alcohol is great for your health, you'll only read the studies on how wine has antioxidants, and whiskey kills bacteria.\n\n### \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u00a0 Framing\n\nNarrative is key. **How a question is framed affects the perception and outcome.**\n\nBit of a morbid example, but let's say you're considering a surgery for cancer and the doctor says the 1 month survival rate is 95%. Fantastic! That's solid. Now, consider this: there's a 5% mortality rate in the first month. Both arguments are logically the same. But survival is good, and mortality is stressful to think about. Framing matters, and tricky framing can disorient our System 1.\n\n### Correlation &amp; Causation\n\nFor those who took Statistics 101, here's a reminder: **Correlation does not imply causation**. Our minds are wired to seek patterns \u2014 and once one's spotted, our ego tempts us to rationalize it. Sometimes it's based on logic, other times \u2014 pure nonsense.\n\nSome fun examples of correlation without causation (though if you think hard enough you can probably come up with a narrative):\n\n* Number of storks and birth rate in Denmark\n* Number of priests in the USA and alcoholism\n* [Pirates cause global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPiratesVsTemp%28en%29.svg)?\n\n### \ud83d\udea3\ud83c\udffe Sunk Cost\n\nAh, Microeconomics 101. During my first year of college, *everyone* was talking about sunk cost. Forcing myself to go to a crappy concert because I already paid for the ticket. Putting more money in a poker game because I had already lost (or invested?) a sum of money. Fun times.\n\n**The more we invest in something, the less likely we are to to let it go.** Sunk costs are past costs that are not recoverable and should not influence future decisions.\n\n### \u2693 Anchoring\n\nA great tool for manipulating consumers. **Anchoring refers to decisions under the influence of an anchor or particular reference point.**\n\nAnchoring is used heavily in consumer retail, software sales, and classic negotiation scenarios.\n\nIf you see a shirt for $500 and another for $200, you'd likely consider the second one cheaper. In comparing three phone plans: 2GB for $60, 5GB for $80, and Unlimited for $100, you may consider the Unlimited option the best bang for buck. But: *Do you even need unlimited? \u2026How much time are you spending on Instagram?*\n\n### \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Availability Bias\n\n**Things that come more readily to mind are more representative than is actually the case.**\n\nWe tend to remember more vivid events such as plane crashes and lottery wins, leading us to overestimate the likelihood of those events occurring. In reality, those are just more graphic, dramatic \u2014 and thus, memorable, occurrences.\n\n### \ud83d\ude07 Halo Effect\n\n**If we judge a person positively in one respect, we're more likely assume they'll be positive in another.** We may assume that a good looking person is also a nice person. Or that a charismatic person is a high performer at work. Perhaps a sharply dressed colleague is a harder worker.\n\n### \ud83d\udcb8 Loss Aversion\n\nDaniel Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for coining this concept. **It's the thought that losing something (e.g. money) is twice is powerful as the pleasure of gaining.** Folks are more willing to take risks to avoid a loss than to make a gain.\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\n1. Would you rather receive $900 with 100% certainty **OR** receive $1000 with 90% certainty and $0 with 10%?\n2. Would you rather lose $900 with 100% certainty **OR** lose $1000 with 90% certainty and lose $0 with 10%?\n\nIn scenario 1, most people would pick the sure gain (more risk averse). In scenario 2, most people would pick the riskier option (losing $1000 at a 90% chance and nothing at a 10%) chance. Mathematically, both options in scenario 1 and scenario 2 result in the same outcomes of $900 or -$900.\n\n## Reducing Bias\n\nAs you've realized by now, we're not naturally logical beings (although we sure think we are). Dealing with bias is something folks in all fields \u2014 at all levels of seniority \u2014 deal with.\n\n**Through discussion, reading, and listening, here's how I recommend you can reduce bias.**\n\n* **Develop an awareness of any potential bias that may be clouding your thinking.** Awareness is always the first step, and while I've listed eight types of bias here, there are many more. Review different types of bias and visualize them in detail. When you encounter a relevant scenario, acknowledge the bias involved and your self-awareness muscle will develop over time.\n* **Pause and consider: is there any additional information I'm missing?** Always seek new information and evidence. Data is king and while we don't always have the luxury of slowing down, we naturally exaggerate the speed of which we need to make a decision, thanks to our hyperactive, anxious brains.\n* **Assess opposing arguments.** I used to work with a colleague and friend who played the role of devil's advocate really well (Hey Noah). Healthy debate creates value. And it's good to keep your ego in check by having someone respectfully challenge your point of view. Some companies even practice [pre-mortems](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/premortem-on-projects#:~:text=A%20premortem%20is%20when%20a,might%20have%20caused%20the%20failure.) \u2014 brainstorming all the ways a project could fail, prior to launching.\n* **Reframe the problem and invert if needed.** By reframing the challenge at hand or decision to be made, you may see the problem differently. I mentioned framing bias above as a negative element. But you can use this as a tool for positive outcomes too. [I discussed Inversion as a practical heuristic in March](https://www.andrew.today/p/using-mental-models-to-optimize-decision).\n* **Rely on past experience and feedback loops.** Have you encountered this problem before in other forms? Experience is the best teacher, though sometimes we tend to forget them. Consider developing a systematic review process to evaluate the quality of your decisions. In most cases, [your product is decisions](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Appreciation &amp; Support\n\nThank you for taking the time to read \u2014 It took a while to put this together.

Perhaps a sharply dressed colleague is a harder worker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\udcb8 Loss Aversion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for coining this concept. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s the thought that losing something (e.g. money) is twice is powerful as the pleasure of gaining.&lt;/strong&gt; Folks are more willing to take risks to avoid a loss than to make a gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would you rather receive $900 with 100% certainty &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; receive $1000 with 90% certainty and $0 with 10%?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would you rather lose $900 with 100% certainty &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; lose $1000 with 90% certainty and lose $0 with 10%?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In scenario 1, most people would pick the sure gain (more risk averse). In scenario 2, most people would pick the riskier option (losing $1000 at a 90% chance and nothing at a 10%) chance. Mathematically, both options in scenario 1 and scenario 2 result in the same outcomes of $900 or -$900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Reducing Bias&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;ve realized by now, we&amp;#39;re not naturally logical beings (although we sure think we are). Dealing with bias is something folks in all fields \u2014 at all levels of seniority \u2014 deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through discussion, reading, and listening, here&amp;#39;s how I recommend you can reduce bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop an awareness of any potential bias that may be clouding your thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness is always the first step, and while I&amp;#39;ve listed eight types of bias here, there are many more. Review different types of bias and visualize them in detail. When you encounter a relevant scenario, acknowledge the bias involved and your self-awareness muscle will develop over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause and consider: is there any additional information I&amp;#39;m missing?&lt;/strong&gt; Always seek new information and evidence. Data is king and while we don&amp;#39;t always have the luxury of slowing down, we naturally exaggerate the speed of which we need to make a decision, thanks to our hyperactive, anxious brains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess opposing arguments.&lt;/strong&gt; I used to work with a colleague and friend who played the role of devil&amp;#39;s advocate really well (Hey Noah). Healthy debate creates value. And it&amp;#39;s good to keep your ego in check by having someone respectfully challenge your point of view. Some companies even practice &lt;a href=\"https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/premortem-on-projects#:%7E:text=A%20premortem%20is%20when%20a,might%20have%20caused%20the%20failure.\"&gt;pre-mortems&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 brainstorming all the ways a project could fail, prior to launching.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe the problem and invert if needed.&lt;/strong&gt; By reframing the challenge at hand or decision to be made, you may see the problem differently. I mentioned framing bias above as a negative element. But you can use this as a tool for positive outcomes too. &lt;a href=\"https://www.andrew.today/p/using-mental-models-to-optimize-decision\"&gt;I discussed Inversion as a practical heuristic in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rely on past experience and feedback loops.&lt;/strong&gt; Have you encountered this problem before in other forms?

[Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).\n\nThinking, Fast and Slow introduced me to the world of clear thinking, decision-making, and mental models. It\u2019s worth a proper read (vs. skimming or reading a summary).\n\n**The TL;DR is that we rely on two systems of thinking:**\n\n* **System 1 (Thinking Fast)** is the intuitive, subconscious \u201cgut response\u201d way of thinking and decision making. It\u2019s always-on and gives us the ability to create fast impressions, judgements, and intuition.\n* **System 2 (Thinking Slow)** is the analytical, logical, intentional way of decision making. It\u2019s used for reflection, analysis, and problem solving.\u00a0\n\nMost of the time, we engage System 1. Which may lead to biased decision making and poorer choices. It\u2019s also easier to use System 1 as it requires much less cognitive effort.\n\n**We have a limited amount of daily cognitive power to use.** Each decision we make taxes our brain and the quality of our decisions begins to erode over the course of a typical day.\n\n* Steve Jobs famously wore the same outfit every day so he never had to think about what to wear.\n* Barack Obama replies to his low priority emails to \"Agree, \"Disagree\" or \"Discuss\" to simplify his workflow.\n\n**Decision fatigue is real and as we consume our mental resources, we subconsciously rely on passive heuristics (mental shortcuts) to make decisions**. That's why it's important to regularly sharpen our mental models.\n\nAcknowledging the cognitive biases that affect our thinking allows us to stay rational. It only takes a second to ask ourselves \"What am I missing here?\" or \"What irrational factors may be influencing my judgement?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are 8 cognitive biases you should know about:**\n\n### \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Confirmation Bias\n\n**People are prone to believe what they want to believe.** Confirmation bias is the tendency to subconsciously seek information to validate existing beliefs.\u00a0\n\nIf you've got a hunch that a company's stock will be successful, you may only look for supporting arguments during your Google search. If you think social media companies are evil, you may be subconsciously biased in the way you frame your questions, \"How evil are social media companies?\". If you believe that alcohol is great for your health, you'll only read the studies on how wine has antioxidants, and whiskey kills bacteria.\n\n### \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u00a0 Framing\n\nNarrative is key. **How a question is framed affects the perception and outcome.**\n\nBit of a morbid example, but let's say you're considering a surgery for cancer and the doctor says the 1 month survival rate is 95%. Fantastic! That's solid. Now, consider this: there's a 5% mortality rate in the first month. Both arguments are logically the same. But survival is good, and mortality is stressful to think about. Framing matters, and tricky framing can disorient our System 1.\n\n### Correlation &amp; Causation\n\nFor those who took Statistics 101, here's a reminder: **Correlation does not imply causation**. Our minds are wired to seek patterns \u2014 and once one's spotted, our ego tempts us to rationalize it. Sometimes it's based on logic, other times \u2014 pure nonsense.\n\nSome fun examples of correlation without causation (though if you think hard enough you can probably come up with a narrative):\n\n* Number of storks and birth rate in Denmark\n* Number of priests in the USA and alcoholism\n* [Pirates cause global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPiratesVsTemp%28en%29.svg)?\n\n### \ud83d\udea3\ud83c\udffe Sunk Cost\n\nAh, Microeconomics 101. During my first year of college, *everyone* was talking about sunk cost. Forcing myself to go to a crappy concert because I already paid for the ticket. Putting more money in a poker game because I had already lost (or invested?) a sum of money. Fun times.\n\n**The more we invest in something, the less likely we are to to let it go.** Sunk costs are past costs that are not recoverable and should not influence future decisions.\n\n### \u2693 Anchoring\n\nA great tool for manipulating consumers. **Anchoring refers to decisions under the influence of an anchor or particular reference point.**\n\nAnchoring is used heavily in consumer retail, software sales, and classic negotiation scenarios.\n\nIf you see a shirt for $500 and another for $200, you'd likely consider the second one cheaper. In comparing three phone plans: 2GB for $60, 5GB for $80, and Unlimited for $100, you may consider the Unlimited option the best bang for buck. But: *Do you even need unlimited? \u2026How much time are you spending on Instagram?*\n\n### \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Availability Bias\n\n**Things that come more readily to mind are more representative than is actually the case.**\n\nWe tend to remember more vivid events such as plane crashes and lottery wins, leading us to overestimate the likelihood of those events occurring. In reality, those are just more graphic, dramatic \u2014 and thus, memorable, occurrences.\n\n### \ud83d\ude07 Halo Effect\n\n**If we judge a person positively in one respect, we're more likely assume they'll be positive in another.** We may assume that a good looking person is also a nice person. Or that a charismatic person is a high performer at work. Perhaps a sharply dressed colleague is a harder worker.\n\n### \ud83d\udcb8 Loss Aversion\n\nDaniel Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for coining this concept. **It's the thought that losing something (e.g. money) is twice is powerful as the pleasure of gaining.** Folks are more willing to take risks to avoid a loss than to make a gain.\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\n1. Would you rather receive $900 with 100% certainty **OR** receive $1000 with 90% certainty and $0 with 10%?\n2. Would you rather lose $900 with 100% certainty **OR** lose $1000 with 90% certainty and lose $0 with 10%?\n\nIn scenario 1, most people would pick the sure gain (more risk averse). In scenario 2, most people would pick the riskier option (losing $1000 at a 90% chance and nothing at a 10%) chance. Mathematically, both options in scenario 1 and scenario 2 result in the same outcomes of $900 or -$900.\n\n## Reducing Bias\n\nAs you've realized by now, we're not naturally logical beings (although we sure think we are). Dealing with bias is something folks in all fields \u2014 at all levels of seniority \u2014 deal with.\n\n**Through discussion, reading, and listening, here's how I recommend you can reduce bias.**\n\n* **Develop an awareness of any potential bias that may be clouding your thinking.** Awareness is always the first step, and while I've listed eight types of bias here, there are many more. Review different types of bias and visualize them in detail. When you encounter a relevant scenario, acknowledge the bias involved and your self-awareness muscle will develop over time.\n* **Pause and consider: is there any additional information I'm missing?** Always seek new information and evidence. Data is king and while we don't always have the luxury of slowing down, we naturally exaggerate the speed of which we need to make a decision, thanks to our hyperactive, anxious brains.\n* **Assess opposing arguments.** I used to work with a colleague and friend who played the role of devil's advocate really well (Hey Noah). Healthy debate creates value. And it's good to keep your ego in check by having someone respectfully challenge your point of view. Some companies even practice [pre-mortems](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/premortem-on-projects#:~:text=A%20premortem%20is%20when%20a,might%20have%20caused%20the%20failure.) \u2014 brainstorming all the ways a project could fail, prior to launching.\n* **Reframe the problem and invert if needed.** By reframing the challenge at hand or decision to be made, you may see the problem differently. I mentioned framing bias above as a negative element. But you can use this as a tool for positive outcomes too. [I discussed Inversion as a practical heuristic in March](https://www.andrew.today/p/using-mental-models-to-optimize-decision).\n* **Rely on past experience and feedback loops.** Have you encountered this problem before in other forms?

It only takes a second to ask ourselves &amp;quot;What am I missing here?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What irrational factors may be influencing my judgement?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 8 cognitive biases you should know about:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Confirmation Bias&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are prone to believe what they want to believe.&lt;/strong&gt; Confirmation bias is the tendency to subconsciously seek information to validate existing beliefs.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve got a hunch that a company&amp;#39;s stock will be successful, you may only look for supporting arguments during your Google search. If you think social media companies are evil, you may be subconsciously biased in the way you frame your questions, &amp;quot;How evil are social media companies?&amp;quot;. If you believe that alcohol is great for your health, you&amp;#39;ll only read the studies on how wine has antioxidants, and whiskey kills bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u00a0 Framing&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Narrative is key. &lt;strong&gt;How a question is framed affects the perception and outcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bit of a morbid example, but let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re considering a surgery for cancer and the doctor says the 1 month survival rate is 95%. Fantastic! That&amp;#39;s solid. Now, consider this: there&amp;#39;s a 5% mortality rate in the first month. Both arguments are logically the same. But survival is good, and mortality is stressful to think about. Framing matters, and tricky framing can disorient our System 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Correlation &amp;amp; Causation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who took Statistics 101, here&amp;#39;s a reminder: &lt;strong&gt;Correlation does not imply causation&lt;/strong&gt;. Our minds are wired to seek patterns \u2014 and once one&amp;#39;s spotted, our ego tempts us to rationalize it. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s based on logic, other times \u2014 pure nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some fun examples of correlation without causation (though if you think hard enough you can probably come up with a narrative):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Number of storks and birth rate in Denmark&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Number of priests in the USA and alcoholism&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPiratesVsTemp%28en%29.svg\"&gt;Pirates cause global warming&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\udea3\ud83c\udffe Sunk Cost&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah, Microeconomics 101. During my first year of college, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; was talking about sunk cost. Forcing myself to go to a crappy concert because I already paid for the ticket. Putting more money in a poker game because I had already lost (or invested?) a sum of money. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more we invest in something, the less likely we are to to let it go.&lt;/strong&gt; Sunk costs are past costs that are not recoverable and should not influence future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\u2693 Anchoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great tool for manipulating consumers. &lt;strong&gt;Anchoring refers to decisions under the influence of an anchor or particular reference point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anchoring is used heavily in consumer retail, software sales, and classic negotiation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see a shirt for $500 and another for $200, you&amp;#39;d likely consider the second one cheaper. In comparing three phone plans: 2GB for $60, 5GB for $80, and Unlimited for $100, you may consider the Unlimited option the best bang for buck. But: &lt;em&gt;Do you even need unlimited? \u2026How much time are you spending on Instagram?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Availability Bias&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that come more readily to mind are more representative than is actually the case.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We tend to remember more vivid events such as plane crashes and lottery wins, leading us to overestimate the likelihood of those events occurring. In reality, those are just more graphic, dramatic \u2014 and thus, memorable, occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\ude07 Halo Effect&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we judge a person positively in one respect, we&amp;#39;re more likely assume they&amp;#39;ll be positive in another.&lt;/strong&gt; We may assume that a good looking person is also a nice person. Or that a charismatic person is a high performer at work. Perhaps a sharply dressed colleague is a harder worker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;\ud83d\udcb8 Loss Aversion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for coining this concept. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s the thought that losing something (e.g. money) is twice is powerful as the pleasure of gaining.&lt;/strong&gt; Folks are more willing to take risks to avoid a loss than to make a gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would you rather receive $900 with 100% certainty &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; receive $1000 with 90% certainty and $0 with 10%?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Would you rather lose $900 with 100% certainty &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; lose $1000 with 90% certainty and lose $0 with 10%?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In scenario 1, most people would pick the sure gain (more risk averse). In scenario 2, most people would pick the riskier option (losing $1000 at a 90% chance and nothing at a 10%) chance. Mathematically, both options in scenario 1 and scenario 2 result in the same outcomes of $900 or -$900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Reducing Bias&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;ve realized by now, we&amp;#39;re not naturally logical beings (although we sure think we are). Dealing with bias is something folks in all fields \u2014 at all levels of seniority \u2014 deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through discussion, reading, and listening, here&amp;#39;s how I recommend you can reduce bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop an awareness of any potential bias that may be clouding your thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness is always the first step, and while I&amp;#39;ve listed eight types of bias here, there are many more. Review different types of bias and visualize them in detail. When you encounter a relevant scenario, acknowledge the bias involved and your self-awareness muscle will develop over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause and consider: is there any additional information I&amp;#39;m missing?&lt;/strong&gt; Always seek new information and evidence. Data is king and while we don&amp;#39;t always have the luxury of slowing down, we naturally exaggerate the speed of which we need to make a decision, thanks to our hyperactive, anxious brains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess opposing arguments.&lt;/strong&gt; I used to work with a colleague and friend who played the role of devil&amp;#39;s advocate really well (Hey Noah). Healthy debate creates value. And it&amp;#39;s good to keep your ego in check by having someone respectfully challenge your point of view. Some companies even practice &lt;a href=\"https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/premortem-on-projects#:%7E:text=A%20premortem%20is%20when%20a,might%20have%20caused%20the%20failure.\"&gt;pre-mortems&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 brainstorming all the ways a project could fail, prior to launching.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe the problem and invert if needed.&lt;/strong&gt; By reframing the challenge at hand or decision to be made, you may see the problem differently. I mentioned framing bias above as a negative element. But you can use this as a tool for positive outcomes too. &lt;a href=\"https://www.andrew.today/p/using-mental-models-to-optimize-decision\"&gt;I discussed Inversion as a practical heuristic in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rely on past experience and feedback loops.&lt;/strong&gt; Have you encountered this problem before in other forms? Experience is the best teacher, though sometimes we tend to forget them. Consider developing a systematic review process to evaluate the quality of your decisions. In most cases, &lt;a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/\"&gt;your product is decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Appreciation &amp;amp; Support&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read \u2014 It took a while to put this together. If this was helpful, I really do appreciate it if you\u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://andrewmp.substack.com/subscribe?\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subscribe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Epictetus told us that **Men are disturbed not by things themselves** but **the view which they take of them**.\n\nOur identities and the way we constantly re-frame ourselves essentially shapes our behaviour and experiences.\n\nPeople often underestimate the way words directly impact actions. \n\n**Bad habits weigh us down on our journey to moral excellence**; like an anchor, they can pull us back. It's our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. \n\nThis identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d \n\nA study published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.\n\nThere were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase **\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d** both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. \n\nAs the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). \n\nThe researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. \n\n39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. \n\nThe idea is then that **one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.**\n\nWe can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. \n\n#Decision fatigue\n\nWe like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.\n\nVeganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).\n\nSome people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. \n\n**Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.**\n\nIn studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).\n\nThere\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. \n\nThis means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates\n\n#Don\u2019t count days. \n\nAnother idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. \n\n**NEVER count days.** Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a \"smoker who went 40 days without it\" or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d\n\n**Every habit is triggered by some event.** For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. \n\nI found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. \n\nThen I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. \n\nThis helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.\n\nThe point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. \n\nTaken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9\n\n#[Watch This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;t)\n\n**Sources:**\n\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions\n\n(1) http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full",

It&amp;#39;s our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/em&gt; tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase &lt;strong&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d&lt;/strong&gt; both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is then that &lt;strong&gt;one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Decision fatigue&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Veganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Don\u2019t count days.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER count days.&lt;/strong&gt; Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a &amp;quot;smoker who went 40 days without it&amp;quot; or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every habit is triggered by some event.&lt;/strong&gt; For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;amp;t\"&gt;Watch This Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Extraneous factors in judicial decisions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full\"&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Happy Monday!\n\nAfter sharing my three principles for effective Learning, I'm back this week with my thoughts on how to craft a perfect study routine. \n\nWhy? It's dead simple. Taking the time to structure your week in advance greatly simplifies your life.\n\nDid you know, that Barack Obama never picked out an outfit in the morning? That's because [Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) is a real thing.\n\nEvery time you make a decision, you pay for it with mental energy. And the more we spend our energy on questions like: \"what will I practice today?\", the less we have to tackle our actual work.\n\nBesides, it will make sure that you don't lose track of what's important when time get's tight.\n\nSure, on an abstract level it is easy to welcome effective study techniques. They got science behind them, they make intuitively sense and they promise you great results. What's not to love?\n\nBut when it's t-3 weeks before the exams and stuff keeps piling up, it is tempting to forget all good intentions and go back to mindlessly re-reading your notes, staying up late to finish one more page and to prioritize that one niche topic over practicing the actual exam work.\n\nThat's why we set up a system in advance. To say it with James Clear's version of Greek Philosopher's Archilochus:\n\n&gt;We don't rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems.\n\nCrafting your study week is like a puzzle. You got the puzzle pieces and you got a puzzle board. Putting them together once you understand both those things and the rules of the game is rather easy. The trick is to actually think it through once, instead of playing Jenga with all of it.\n\n# Step 1: Gather your pieces\n\nFirst, our pieces. That's the work you do in any given week. While everyone's pieces will look slightly different, we can distinguish between four types of pieces: the four key elements of learning:\n\n* **First Exposure** \\- listening to a lecture, reading a course book, watching an explanation. Whatever you do in the beginning to get a first idea of the topic.\n* **Understanding** \\- really getting a hang of the idea. What does it do? How does it relate to other stuff you know? Why does it matter?\n* **Practicing** \\- applying your newfound knowledge. Exactly in the way you ultimately need it. In other words, [Direct Practice](https://matthiasfrank.de/the-three-principles-of-effective-learning/).\n* **Internalizing** \\- interweaving the new topic with what you already know. You could also call it memorizing.\n\nEach one of these pieces deserves it's own dedicated post, so here, we can only scratch the surface. The most important aspects you need to keep in mind are:\n\n* **Never internalize before you understand**. You are not allowed to put down an internalizing piece before you placed the understanding piece.\n* **Practice doesn't require internalization**. To the contrary, practicing will help you to remember it later. So both pieces should be played together.\n* **First exposure and internalizing will never use the same medium**. In other words, you will never just re-listen, re-read or re-watch something, because that is passive and ineffective. If your Internalizing piece looks like a First Exposure piece... it's First Exposure, not Internalizing.\n\nA good puzzle, just as a good routine, lives from a sufficient balance between pieces. Sure, that all-black-puzzle looks like a fun challenge. But it's similarly hard to pass your exams if you just try to internalize things as it is to solve this [crazy puzzle here](https://wtfgames.com.au/products/black-jigsaw-puzzle).\n\nSo always remember (particularly in the beginning!): Never omit Understanding and Practicing for First Exposure and Internalizing. They all work hand in hand.\n\n## Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nTake a piece of paper and do the following (10 min)\n\n* on the left, write down the four categories (1/2 min)\n* next to them, note the activities your currently doing. (3 min)  \ne.g. listen to Criminal Law 101 for First Exposure\n* revise: are all steps represented? Typical imbalances are: (2 min)  \n\n   * You learn more new things every day, but never internalize\n   * You never bother to understand. A clear indicator for that usually is the feeling of having to just remember random and arbitrary facts. While you may need to do that occasionally, it is much more likely that you haven't found the inherent logic behind it yet.\n   * You amass theoretical knowledge without ever practicing it\n* adjust: brainstorm missing parts (4 1/2 min)  \n\n   * **trouble Understanding**? Try Knowledge Trees or Mindmapping for structural knowledge or the Feynman Technique for conceptual knowledge\n   * **trouble Internalizing**? Build a habit of revising old stuff first thing in the morning before you do the regular work. Don't confuse it with First Exposure though and always, always use Active Recall\n   * **trouble Practicing**? Remember that unless you train for a Quiz Show, facts alone won't win the game. Get yourself practice sets and do mock exams. If you can't practice the exam itself, get as close as possible (e.g. write essays to last years questions) or dissect it into parts\n\nI'll take a detailed look at Knowledge Trees, Mindmapping, the Feynman Technique, The Revision Timetable, The Pomodoro Technique &amp; Drills in another post. It will be on reddit again - alternatively, you can also read it on my blog.\n\n# Step 2: Understand yourself\n\nOnce you figured out the pieces, you need to focus on the board: yourself. Your puzzle pieces can't be placed everywhere equally. This is a next-level puzzle, not your oldschool kindergarden stuff.\n\nDo you actually know when you work best?\n\nWe all have phases of higher and lower mental energy throughout the day. And for the most part, it would be much more efficient to accommodate to this instead of fighting it with energy drinks and the like.\n\nTake another piece of paper aaaaand...\n\n* quickly sketch out a day, dividing it up in two-hour-parts each. You can go more granular, but for now, a rough idea is sufficient.\n* now fill in the segments. When do you actually get work done? When are you focused enough to tackle that new and complicated subject? And when do you mostly work on autopilot? To keep things easy, I'd stick with three levels: Hyper-Focus, Normal-Mode and Crazy-Lazy.\n\nIf you have no idea how to fill this out, then keep an Energy Journal for one or two regular work days. Start with the same sketch of the day and fill in each part as you go through it.\n\nMost important thing here is honesty. It's okay if your day can only start at 12 o'clock. Fill in how you feel, not how you think you should.\n\n# Step 3: Structure your day\n\nWe got the pieces. We got the board. Time to play.\n\nUltimately, no one can tell you how your perfect week looks like. So instead of giving you a recipe that is to be followed to the point, I'll give you some general techniques to apply:\n\n## Input vs. Output\n\nThere are generally two ways to schedule your work. You either focus on input or on output.\n\n* **Output focus** is the way we typically approach things. Output is about setting goals and measuring how well you achieve them.  \nFor studying, that would mean to break down in advance what you want to achieve in a given day. You could simply add up all pages you need to read and divide them by the number of days. Or divide the question sets that need revision into daily chunks.  \n**DOs and DON'Ts**  \n\n   * Do write down your goals a day in advance\n   * Do keep a reasonable workload. It's all about setting realistic expectations.\n   * Don't keep working. Once you're done, you're done. Reward yourself for effective work instead of just piling on and on. It will help with motivation long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro**: easily track progress, reward yourself for efficient working\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Input focus** on the other hand puts your time first. Instead of working toward a goal, you work for a specific time.  \nYou can set this up without much advance planning. How many hours a day are you able to work at least semi-productive? That's the time you have available to use as study time. Just block it in your calendar, and you're good to go.  \n**DOs and DON'Ts**  \n\n   * Do plan according to your energy levels (see below). Distribute your workload effectively.\n   * Do some thinking ahead of time about what to work on. Not focusing on output \u2260 not knowing what to work on.\n   * Don't keep working once time is up. [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) knows, that your work expands to the time allocated for it. Few things counteract procrastination as effectively as a fixed deadline. Treat them as such or they will lose any effect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro**: easy to set up, fixed schedule helps with creating habits, more flexible to adapt if the things you need to work on change suddenly\n\nWhich one to choose? I'll write in debt about them soon, but for now, this should be a good starting point for you to pick one:\n\n* Do you have a lot of different things to do that need handling? Can you easily estimate the time it would take for each of them? Examples would be a regular study semester, where you got a number of classes and several assignments to work on weekly.  \n\u2192 use the output method\n* Are you working towards big, hard to measure tasks? Is it one big project, where goal setting is arbitrary or a lot of work? An example would be a master thesis or a catch-all exam like the bar exam  \n\u2192 use the input method\n\n## Blocking vs. Interweaving\n\nWhen it comes to topics, there are again two main approaches: you can either work en block on a specific topic or interweave them. While the first aspect was more of a personal choice, we got some pretty good scientific pointers for this one. The answer? It depends:\n\n* for your First Exposure and Understanding, you want to work en block on a specific topic. Chances are, that you are dealing with complicated questions. You really need to take the time and dive in deep.  \nScience has shown over and over again, that multitasking is a bad idea and frankly, doesn't work. [If you take your mind of something, you'll need on average 25 minutes to fully refocus](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html). 25 minutes!  \nNow in law and probably in every other subject too, there are enough questions that require thinking through a whole lot of pre-concepts again before you can tackle a new question. The intrinsics of mortgages are fun to deal with - but they take time.  \nIf you switch between complex topics, you'd have to go through those \"initial set up thoughts\" time and time again. Save the time and finish one after the other.\n* when it comes to Practicing and Internalizing though, mixing it up is what you should aim for. It's rather intuitive why:  \nWhen I was in school and had to memorize French vocabulary, I hated mixing things up. I would go down my list exactly as I wrote it down, always the same direction \"German to French\". That was easy. Because it was familiar. My brain new what came after \"boulangerie\", because it came there every time.  \nOur brains love connections. And the more often we repeat them, the better we get at them. But most of the time, those connections are arbitrary. It's most likely not the connection you need later on. So we get tricked twice: first, we confuse familiarity with knowledge (Recognizing something is not the same as remembering something) and second, we might form suboptimal connections.  \nWe already know that easy practice is most likely ineffective practice. Mixing up your topics for Internalization or Practice amps up the difficulty significantly. So I guess it comes at no surprise, [that studies have shown improved learning, when students interweave topics.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/)\n\n## High Energy vs. Low Energy\n\nThis one is a no-brainer, but it's worth to quickly consider whether you act accordingly: are you doing the most intense work during times of high energy?\n\nIn my opinion, this is how the four key elements are structured in terms of required Energy Level (from high to low)\n\nUnderstanding &gt; First Exposure &gt; Practice &gt; Internalizing\n\nThat's not to say that you should try to internalize things while you are at your all-day energy low point - that's the time where you take a break. But maybe don't spend your most productive time going through flashcards, when you could finally figure out instead why you need to learn them in the first place.\n\nThere is one exception to this rule: the eat-the-frog-principle:\n\n&gt;Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day - Mark Twain\n\nIf there is a thing on your to-do list that you either (a) really really don't want to do or (b) always forget, try doing it first.\n\nAbort mission quickly, if that means you start your day four hours later than usual, because you really really really don't want to do it.\n\n## Hard work vs. Relaxation\n\nTime to reiterate my memento mori: you don't have unlimited energy.\n\nIf your work schedule is all work, then it won't work. It's that simple. So make sure to plan sufficient breaks inbetween sessions. Have a low point after lunch? Take a nap, go out for a walk, play some videogames (if you can stop after \"some\") or work out. Meditate. Read my blog. Really anything, but don't \"power through\". While you might be able to do that occasionally, it won't be a sustainable habit.\n\nYour energy resembles resembles a bank account (s/o to [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/)). You can only continue to withdraw if you fill it up from time to time.\n\nEveryone is different, so there is no \"fit-all\" approach. Take five minutes and quickly brainstorm:\n\n* what makes you feel \"recharged\"?\n* What relaxes you?\n\nHere's some inspiration:\n\n* Get **8 hours of sleep**, minimum. This is non-negotionable and it's rather unlikely that you are an outlier who get's away with 4 hours per night.\n* Have a **wind-down routine** after work. I personally need at least two hours after dropping the pen to get my mind clear. Focus on the routine part: if you study in a routine, you might want to relax in a routine too.  \nThat doesn't mean that you can never do something unplanned. But just as fixed work routines signals \"time to focus\" to your brain, so does a \"unwind routine\".  \nTriggers could be a specific sort of music (try rain sounds, Jazz or XX on youtube), leaving your study place for good or changing from cold white to warm light\n* Give **meditation** a shot. I'll cover it in depth in a different post, but for now, this is a good starting point:  \nSit upright and comfortably. Put a 5 minute timer on your phone. Breathe in deeply through your nose, breath out through your mouth. Repeat 3-5 times. Close your eyes and let the breath return to a natural rhythm. Now just rest your attention on the flow of breath. Feel where your body expands and retracts. And don't worry if your mind wanders. The aim of meditation is not to stop your mind from wandering. It's to become aware of when it does and then just return to your focus point.  \nFor guided meditation, check out [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/)!\n\nAnd with this, I leave you to it. Take that piece of paper and go through these steps to set yourself up for success.\n\n  \nNext time, I'll take a look at individual study techniques. You can find my blog in my profile - or just keep an eye out in this subreddit!\n\nI'd love to hear from you how your study routine looks like! Got any tips for me what I should include as well?",

It&amp;#39;s dead simple. Taking the time to structure your week in advance greatly simplifies your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you know, that Barack Obama never picked out an outfit in the morning? That&amp;#39;s because &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue\"&gt;Decision Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; is a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time you make a decision, you pay for it with mental energy. And the more we spend our energy on questions like: &amp;quot;what will I practice today?&amp;quot;, the less we have to tackle our actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, it will make sure that you don&amp;#39;t lose track of what&amp;#39;s important when time get&amp;#39;s tight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, on an abstract level it is easy to welcome effective study techniques. They got science behind them, they make intuitively sense and they promise you great results. What&amp;#39;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it&amp;#39;s t-3 weeks before the exams and stuff keeps piling up, it is tempting to forget all good intentions and go back to mindlessly re-reading your notes, staying up late to finish one more page and to prioritize that one niche topic over practicing the actual exam work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we set up a system in advance. To say it with James Clear&amp;#39;s version of Greek Philosopher&amp;#39;s Archilochus:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crafting your study week is like a puzzle. You got the puzzle pieces and you got a puzzle board. Putting them together once you understand both those things and the rules of the game is rather easy. The trick is to actually think it through once, instead of playing Jenga with all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Step 1: Gather your pieces&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, our pieces. That&amp;#39;s the work you do in any given week. While everyone&amp;#39;s pieces will look slightly different, we can distinguish between four types of pieces: the four key elements of learning:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Exposure&lt;/strong&gt; - listening to a lecture, reading a course book, watching an explanation. Whatever you do in the beginning to get a first idea of the topic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding&lt;/strong&gt; - really getting a hang of the idea. What does it do? How does it relate to other stuff you know? Why does it matter?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practicing&lt;/strong&gt; - applying your newfound knowledge. Exactly in the way you ultimately need it. In other words, &lt;a href=\"https://matthiasfrank.de/the-three-principles-of-effective-learning/\"&gt;Direct Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internalizing&lt;/strong&gt; - interweaving the new topic with what you already know. You could also call it memorizing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one of these pieces deserves it&amp;#39;s own dedicated post, so here, we can only scratch the surface. The most important aspects you need to keep in mind are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never internalize before you understand&lt;/strong&gt;. You are not allowed to put down an internalizing piece before you placed the understanding piece.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice doesn&amp;#39;t require internalization&lt;/strong&gt;. To the contrary, practicing will help you to remember it later. So both pieces should be played together.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First exposure and internalizing will never use the same medium&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, you will never just re-listen, re-read or re-watch something, because that is passive and ineffective. If your Internalizing piece looks like a First Exposure piece... it&amp;#39;s First Exposure, not Internalizing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good puzzle, just as a good routine, lives from a sufficient balance between pieces. Sure, that all-black-puzzle looks like a fun challenge. But it&amp;#39;s similarly hard to pass your exams if you just try to internalize things as it is to solve this &lt;a href=\"https://wtfgames.com.au/products/black-jigsaw-puzzle\"&gt;crazy puzzle here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So always remember (particularly in the beginning!): Never omit Understanding and Practicing for First Exposure and Internalizing. They all work hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Here\u2019s what to do:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a piece of paper and do the following (10 min)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;on the left, write down the four categories (1/2 min)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;next to them, note the activities your currently doing. (3 min)&lt;br/&gt;\ne.g. listen to Criminal Law 101 for First Exposure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;revise: are all steps represented? Typical imbalances are: (2 min)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You learn more new things every day, but never internalize&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You never bother to understand. A clear indicator for that usually is the feeling of having to just remember random and arbitrary facts. While you may need to do that occasionally, it is much more likely that you haven&amp;#39;t found the inherent logic behind it yet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You amass theoretical knowledge without ever practicing it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;adjust: brainstorm missing parts (4 1/2 min)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trouble Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;? Try Knowledge Trees or Mindmapping for structural knowledge or the Feynman Technique for conceptual knowledge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trouble Internalizing&lt;/strong&gt;? Build a habit of revising old stuff first thing in the morning before you do the regular work. Don&amp;#39;t confuse it with First Exposure though and always, always use Active Recall&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trouble Practicing&lt;/strong&gt;? Remember that unless you train for a Quiz Show, facts alone won&amp;#39;t win the game. Get yourself practice sets and do mock exams. If you can&amp;#39;t practice the exam itself, get as close as possible (e.g. write essays to last years questions) or dissect it into parts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll take a detailed look at Knowledge Trees, Mindmapping, the Feynman Technique, The Revision Timetable, The Pomodoro Technique &amp;amp; Drills in another post. It will be on reddit again - alternatively, you can also read it on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Step 2: Understand yourself&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you figured out the pieces, you need to focus on the board: yourself. Your puzzle pieces can&amp;#39;t be placed everywhere equally. This is a next-level puzzle, not your oldschool kindergarden stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you actually know when you work best?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all have phases of higher and lower mental energy throughout the day. And for the most part, it would be much more efficient to accommodate to this instead of fighting it with energy drinks and the like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take another piece of paper aaaaand...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;quickly sketch out a day, dividing it up in two-hour-parts each. You can go more granular, but for now, a rough idea is sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;now fill in the segments. When do you actually get work done? When are you focused enough to tackle that new and complicated subject? And when do you mostly work on autopilot? To keep things easy, I&amp;#39;d stick with three levels: Hyper-Focus, Normal-Mode and Crazy-Lazy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have no idea how to fill this out, then keep an Energy Journal for one or two regular work days. Start with the same sketch of the day and fill in each part as you go through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most important thing here is honesty. It&amp;#39;s okay if your day can only start at 12 o&amp;#39;clock. Fill in how you feel, not how you think you should.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Step 3: Structure your day&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got the pieces. We got the board. Time to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no one can tell you how your perfect week looks like. So instead of giving you a recipe that is to be followed to the point, I&amp;#39;ll give you some general techniques to apply:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Input vs. Output&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are generally two ways to schedule your work. You either focus on input or on output.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output focus&lt;/strong&gt; is the way we typically approach things. Output is about setting goals and measuring how well you achieve them.&lt;br/&gt;\nFor studying, that would mean to break down in advance what you want to achieve in a given day. You could simply add up all pages you need to read and divide them by the number of days. Or divide the question sets that need revision into daily chunks.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;DOs and DON&amp;#39;Ts&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do write down your goals a day in advance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do keep a reasonable workload. It&amp;#39;s all about setting realistic expectations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t keep working. Once you&amp;#39;re done, you&amp;#39;re done. Reward yourself for effective work instead of just piling on and on. It will help with motivation long term.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: easily track progress, reward yourself for efficient working&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input focus&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand puts your time first. Instead of working toward a goal, you work for a specific time.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou can set this up without much advance planning. How many hours a day are you able to work at least semi-productive? That&amp;#39;s the time you have available to use as study time. Just block it in your calendar, and you&amp;#39;re good to go.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;DOs and DON&amp;#39;Ts&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do plan according to your energy levels (see below). Distribute your workload effectively.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do some thinking ahead of time about what to work on. Not focusing on output \u2260 not knowing what to work on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t keep working once time is up. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law\"&gt;Parkinson&amp;#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt; knows, that your work expands to the time allocated for it. Few things counteract procrastination as effectively as a fixed deadline. Treat them as such or they will lose any effect.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: easy to set up, fixed schedule helps with creating habits, more flexible to adapt if the things you need to work on change suddenly&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which one to choose? I&amp;#39;ll write in debt about them soon, but for now, this should be a good starting point for you to pick one:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you have a lot of different things to do that need handling? Can you easily estimate the time it would take for each of them? Examples would be a regular study semester, where you got a number of classes and several assignments to work on weekly.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2192 use the output method&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you working towards big, hard to measure tasks? Is it one big project, where goal setting is arbitrary or a lot of work? An example would be a master thesis or a catch-all exam like the bar exam&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2192 use the input method&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Blocking vs. Interweaving&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to topics, there are again two main approaches: you can either work en block on a specific topic or interweave them. While the first aspect was more of a personal choice, we got some pretty good scientific pointers for this one. The answer? It depends:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;for your First Exposure and Understanding, you want to work en block on a specific topic. Chances are, that you are dealing with complicated questions. You really need to take the time and dive in deep.&lt;br/&gt;\nScience has shown over and over again, that multitasking is a bad idea and frankly, doesn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html\"&gt;If you take your mind of something, you&amp;#39;ll need on average 25 minutes to fully refocus&lt;/a&gt;. 25 minutes!&lt;br/&gt;\nNow in law and probably in every other subject too, there are enough questions that require thinking through a whole lot of pre-concepts again before you can tackle a new question. The intrinsics of mortgages are fun to deal with - but they take time.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you switch between complex topics, you&amp;#39;d have to go through those &amp;quot;initial set up thoughts&amp;quot; time and time again. Save the time and finish one after the other.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;when it comes to Practicing and Internalizing though, mixing it up is what you should aim for. It&amp;#39;s rather intuitive why:&lt;br/&gt;\nWhen I was in school and had to memorize French vocabulary, I hated mixing things up. I would go down my list exactly as I wrote it down, always the same direction &amp;quot;German to French&amp;quot;. That was easy. Because it was familiar. My brain new what came after &amp;quot;boulangerie&amp;quot;, because it came there every time.&lt;br/&gt;\nOur brains love connections. And the more often we repeat them, the better we get at them. But most of the time, those connections are arbitrary. It&amp;#39;s most likely not the connection you need later on. So we get tricked twice: first, we confuse familiarity with knowledge (Recognizing something is not the same as remembering something) and second, we might form suboptimal connections.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe already know that easy practice is most likely ineffective practice. Mixing up your topics for Internalization or Practice amps up the difficulty significantly. So I guess it comes at no surprise, &lt;a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/\"&gt;that studies have shown improved learning, when students interweave topics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;High Energy vs. Low Energy&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is a no-brainer, but it&amp;#39;s worth to quickly consider whether you act accordingly: are you doing the most intense work during times of high energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is how the four key elements are structured in terms of required Energy Level (from high to low)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding &amp;gt; First Exposure &amp;gt; Practice &amp;gt; Internalizing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say that you should try to internalize things while you are at your all-day energy low point - that&amp;#39;s the time where you take a break. But maybe don&amp;#39;t spend your most productive time going through flashcards, when you could finally figure out instead why you need to learn them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is one exception to this rule: the eat-the-frog-principle:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day - Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there is a thing on your to-do list that you either (a) really really don&amp;#39;t want to do or (b) always forget, try doing it first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abort mission quickly, if that means you start your day four hours later than usual, because you really really really don&amp;#39;t want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Hard work vs. Relaxation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time to reiterate my memento mori: you don&amp;#39;t have unlimited energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your work schedule is all work, then it won&amp;#39;t work. It&amp;#39;s that simple. So make sure to plan sufficient breaks inbetween sessions. Have a low point after lunch? Take a nap, go out for a walk, play some videogames (if you can stop after &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;) or work out. Meditate. Read my blog. Really anything, but don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;power through&amp;quot;. While you might be able to do that occasionally, it won&amp;#39;t be a sustainable habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your energy resembles resembles a bank account (s/o to &lt;a href=\"https://www.scotthyoung.com/\"&gt;Scott Young&lt;/a&gt;). You can only continue to withdraw if you fill it up from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is different, so there is no &amp;quot;fit-all&amp;quot; approach. Take five minutes and quickly brainstorm:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;what makes you feel &amp;quot;recharged&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What relaxes you?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;strong&gt;8 hours of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, minimum. This is non-negotionable and it&amp;#39;s rather unlikely that you are an outlier who get&amp;#39;s away with 4 hours per night.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a &lt;strong&gt;wind-down routine&lt;/strong&gt; after work. I personally need at least two hours after dropping the pen to get my mind clear. Focus on the routine part: if you study in a routine, you might want to relax in a routine too.&lt;br/&gt;\nThat doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can never do something unplanned. But just as fixed work routines signals &amp;quot;time to focus&amp;quot; to your brain, so does a &amp;quot;unwind routine&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;\nTriggers could be a specific sort of music (try rain sounds, Jazz or XX on youtube), leaving your study place for good or changing from cold white to warm light&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Give &lt;strong&gt;meditation&lt;/strong&gt; a shot. I&amp;#39;ll cover it in depth in a different post, but for now, this is a good starting point:&lt;br/&gt;\nSit upright and comfortably. Put a 5 minute timer on your phone. Breathe in deeply through your nose, breath out through your mouth. Repeat 3-5 times. Close your eyes and let the breath return to a natural rhythm. Now just rest your attention on the flow of breath. Feel where your body expands and retracts. And don&amp;#39;t worry if your mind wanders. The aim of meditation is not to stop your mind from wandering. It&amp;#39;s to become aware of when it does and then just return to your focus point.&lt;br/&gt;\nFor guided meditation, check out &lt;a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with this, I leave you to it. Take that piece of paper and go through these steps to set yourself up for success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, I&amp;#39;ll take a look at individual study techniques. You can find my blog in my profile - or just keep an eye out in this subreddit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you how your study routine looks like! Got any tips for me what I should include as well?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This explains why we can list out all of our projects, break them down into smaller chunks, organize and prioritize everything extensively in various apps using various systems, and still end up not getting things done like we\u2019d like. \u00a0A lot of what we might think of as \u201cprocrastination\u201d and scold ourselves for being lazy, could really just be choice overwhelm. \u00a0Anyone who has a hard time getting things done should read this book. \u00a0When it comes to larger projects, there are two main approaches I\u2019ve tried in the past:\n\n1. **Consistent, Daily Action**\n2. **\u201cDeep Work\u201d (ala Cal Newport)**\n\nSome stuff, like \u201cget fit\u201d can only be done with approach #1. \u00a0It takes daily exercise and nutrition. \u00a0You can\u2019t just lock yourself in a cabin in the woods for a week and workout every waking hour and then walk out \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cdone\u201d with that project.\n\nOther tasks can be done with either approach. \u00a0I really like #2 whenever its appropriate. \u00a0This is why systems like GTD never really worked for me. \u00a0I tried it for years using Omnifocus at first and later, Things. \u00a0But I didn\u2019t like the way it disconnects individual broken down tasks from their larger projects. During a weekly review, you can look at these connections, but during the week, I lose motivation to do things when I can\u2019t see how they fit into the bigger picture. \u00a0There\u2019s just a list of possible tasks I can choose, and I vaguely know they are each pushing one goal or another a small step forward, but doing them feels a bit disconnected and hollow, not to mention I\u2019m not really seeing very much visible progress in any one goal each time I do one which has a big effect on motivation. \u00a0And this system doesn\u2019t solve the problem of choice overwhelm. \u00a0Yes, for each project, you are simply focusing on the \u201cnext action,\u201d but then you just have a list of a bunch of possible next actions for different projects, none of which you can really see the big picture of without loading them all in your head to evaluate which should happen next. \u00a0And when you take a bunch of larger projects and break them down into small discrete chunks, you create a **LOT**\u00a0of them which makes the choice problem worse.\n\nCalendars and scheduling everything doesn\u2019t work for me either, because:\n\n1. We are bad at predicting how long things will take to get done\n2. We are bad at predicting the complexity or physical/mental energy things will take\n3. Shit happens, and throws your schedule off and it has to be reworked\n4. You are still staring at everything you have to do and with time pressure\n5. Even though it seems the decisions of \u201cwhat to do when\u201d have been made, that\u2019s an illusion since you\u2019ll often have to redo all those \u00a0choices when something doesn\u2019t go according to plan.\n\nOne system that has worked for me somewhat is making a list the night before. \u00a0I usually list out urgent/important things, prioritize everything into a list and then put another piece of paper over everything except the top item. \u00a0Then the next day I wake up fresh, all the thinking and planning has been done the night before so it\u2019s not all cluttered in my head and I can\u2019t remember it all, and all I can see is the next task. \u00a0I trust that I\u2019ve got the most important/urgent thing first and give myself permission to let that be the only thing I do today. \u00a0Usually with that mentality I\u2019ve worked my way really far down that list and got a lot done.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect though. \u00a0I don\u2019t always have the time to make a list every night. \u00a0Also, I still need to \u201cstore\u201d all my other projects and tasks, goals, someday/maybe stuff, etc somewhere. I haven\u2019t found the perfect system, but I\u2019m trying to think it through now with everything I\u2019ve learned that doesn\u2019t work, and WHY it doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s some things I\u2019ve found that make this so difficult:\n\nIn any to do list you can have a bunch of tasks on it which differ in a number of important ways:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Duration:**\u00a0Emailing someone vs get new tires (note that can easily take more than an hour and can\u2019t be broken down into sub-tasks. \u00a0Other non-divisible tasks could take even longer.)\n\n**Urgency:** A project due tomorrow vs something due in a month\n\n**Importance:** Exercise vs checking out a tv show someone recommended\u00a0\n\n**Physical energy required:** Mow and rake the lawn vs research flights\n\n**Mental energy/focus required:**\u00a0Study vs do laundry\n\n**Single task or part of larger goal:** \u00a0Even within larger goal, is it part of a larger goal that is completable (finishing a discrete project), or part of a larger goal with no end (even after you \u201cget fit\u201d you can\u2019t stop exercising - there\u2019s no end). \u00a0You could also call this \u201crecurring or step-by-step\u201d)\n\n**In your current\u00a0\u201corbit\u201d or a someday/maybe wish:**\u00a0Some things you\u2019ve got on the brain and want to do currently, and others are just things you want to get out of your head and want to do but are on the back burner. \u00a0And things shift over time between the two.\n\n**Interest**: Some tasks you have a much greater desire to do than others and are willing to spend a lot more time and energy on.\n\nCombine this with the reality that most of us are bad at predicting the time something will take, it\u2019s complexity, and/or how much energy it will require.\n\nI so far haven\u2019t found a system that works to handle all of this complexity, and yet give me the ability to adjust the complexity of my view of my todo list to avoid overwhelm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other complexities, such as the fact that most tasks have different combinations of these qualities and might therefore need to be dealt with differently. \u00a0Exercise is a recurring task that is part of a larger goal that has no end, requires lots of physical energy, is important but not urgent and should always be in your \u201corbit.\u201d \u00a0However, if it\u2019s a daily task, and it's important to you, do you really need to put it on a to-do list? \u00a0It\u2019s more a part of a routine. \u00a0In that case some may suggest putting that in another app (system) like a habit tracker app. \u00a0But then you start to have a clutter of apps, because there are other things you need to keep track of that aren\u2019t even habits or tasks. \u00a0That show someone recommended to you, where do you store that? \u00a0it\u2019s more like a reminder, but for when? \u00a0There\u2019s no set time, it\u2019s more of a \u201cwhen i have free time.\u201d \u00a0Well thats inextricably linked to your todos because you should only be doing that, and ideally only reminded to do it, when you have things that are not more urgent or important.\n\n\u201cTaking out the trash\u201d is a discrete task that is short in duration, doesn\u2019t require much physical or mental energy, and isn\u2019t part of a larger goal\u2026 UNLESS you consider it part of \u201ccleaning your house.\u201d \u00a0Now, are you going to put a \u201cClean my House\u201d project and divide it into subcategories like \u201cKitchen\u201d \u201cLiving Room\u201d \u201cBathroom\u201d etc which are further broken down into tasks? \u00a0Seems a bit overkill. \u00a0Also this is a large project that happens to be both a discrete one with an end, and a recurring one with no end at the same time. You can get your whole house \u201cclean\u201d and be \u201cdone.\u201d \u00a0But eventually you have to do it all over again (but some parts of it more/less often than others!!).\n\nSome tasks may have more importance or urgency, but you might have a lot of resistance to doing, while others are much more interesting and are important (but less so). \u00a0Is your time better served procrastinating the more important/urgent items and end up not doing them at all or only doing a little, or getting a LOT done with the somewhat less important but more interesting tasks that you\u2019d rather do. \u00a0In the overall scheme of things, that might be better.\n\nAnd then there is the problem of even when you don\u2019t have things that are currently urgent, and you\u2019ve handled your most important tasks, you may have a whole bunch of possible things you can do which aren\u2019t necessarily more urgent/important than each other and you can choose any. \u00a0Having so much choice can lead to overwhelm and cause you to do nothing. \u00a0It\u2019s especially hard when some of these are not just discrete tasks but larger projects and you have limited time and have to choose wisely. \u00a0Your someday/maybe list is probably not pre-organized in any sort of a hierarchy that would allow you to limit your overwhelm of choice. \u00a0And even if it were, someday/maybe lists usually sit undisturbed for long periods of time, during which your priorities, interests, and circumstances usually change and shift so that prioritization might be obsolete by the time you look at it next in which case you now have to stuff your head with endless possibilities anyway since you\u2019d have to reprioritize it.\n\nI don\u2019t really have answers, but I do know what would work for me is a system vastly more simple, with less choice. \u00a0If there was some way to navigate all of this complexity and create a list that only shows you the best thing to do now and hides everything else, and adjusts as things change over time. \u00a0Maybe there could still be something like a \u201cweekly review\u201d where you take a look at everything, starting with the things that are most important to you in your life (and maybe just those things). \u00a0Automate as much as possible, focus on fewer, more important things, and do \u201cdeep work\u201d on them. \u00a0Take a particular project and just work on it in your spare time until it is done a day, week, or month later, and let other things that aren\u2019t strictly necessary get handled another time. \u00a0I am a fan of the **consistent, daily action**\u00a0approach as well, but I think it can easily get out of hand because people don\u2019t stick to one or two things, they start piling on multiple simultaneous projects (\"Every morning I\u2019ll do 30min of programming practice, then 30min of learning photoshop, then 30min of reading, then 30min of X\", and on and on). \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s really all the other \u201cstuff\u201d and the organization and worry about it that is the problem, at least for me. \u00a0The more fully present you are, your mind completely free of any other tasks, deadlines, worries about whether the task you chose is the right one, the more you\u2019ll be able to focus and get things done. \u00a0\u201cDeep work\u201d helps with this (or larger chunks of \u201cconsistent, daily action\u201d) because there\u2019s no task-switching costs, you aren\u2019t constantly starting and stopping different, unrelated tasks and you can see faster progress which is motivating.\n\n**TL;DR:** A lot of procrastination is probably just choice overwhelm and decision fatigue, along with an inability to be fully present because of worries about whether your choice of task was the correct one, or whether you\u2019ll get everything you have to get done done. \u00a0A lot of systems that tell you to break larger projects into smaller tasks are probably making decision fatigue much worse and making it harder for you to see progress because of the disconnect they create between the task and the bigger picture, along with the cost of task-switching and the lack of being able to build any momentum on anything. Projects are probably better handled by making hard choices about what\u2019s really important and then doing \u201cdeep work\u201d (see Cal Newport) on those projects, or taking a \u201cconsistent daily action\u201d approach on just a few things.\n\nDisclaimer: \u00a0Yes, I\u2019m aware every one\u2019s situation is different, some people have tons to do and lots of deadlines and spouses and children etc. \u00a0This is a given, so I\u2019m hoping everyone can use common sense and just use this info in whatever way can apply to their situation.\n\nEdit: formatting.",

This explains why we can list out all of our projects, break them down into smaller chunks, organize and prioritize everything extensively in various apps using various systems, and still end up not getting things done like we\u2019d like. \u00a0A lot of what we might think of as \u201cprocrastination\u201d and scold ourselves for being lazy, could really just be choice overwhelm. \u00a0Anyone who has a hard time getting things done should read this book. \u00a0When it comes to larger projects, there are two main approaches I\u2019ve tried in the past:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent, Daily Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cDeep Work\u201d (ala Cal Newport)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some stuff, like \u201cget fit\u201d can only be done with approach #1. \u00a0It takes daily exercise and nutrition. \u00a0You can\u2019t just lock yourself in a cabin in the woods for a week and workout every waking hour and then walk out \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cdone\u201d with that project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other tasks can be done with either approach. \u00a0I really like #2 whenever its appropriate. \u00a0This is why systems like GTD never really worked for me. \u00a0I tried it for years using Omnifocus at first and later, Things. \u00a0But I didn\u2019t like the way it disconnects individual broken down tasks from their larger projects. During a weekly review, you can look at these connections, but during the week, I lose motivation to do things when I can\u2019t see how they fit into the bigger picture. \u00a0There\u2019s just a list of possible tasks I can choose, and I vaguely know they are each pushing one goal or another a small step forward, but doing them feels a bit disconnected and hollow, not to mention I\u2019m not really seeing very much visible progress in any one goal each time I do one which has a big effect on motivation. \u00a0And this system doesn\u2019t solve the problem of choice overwhelm. \u00a0Yes, for each project, you are simply focusing on the \u201cnext action,\u201d but then you just have a list of a bunch of possible next actions for different projects, none of which you can really see the big picture of without loading them all in your head to evaluate which should happen next. \u00a0And when you take a bunch of larger projects and break them down into small discrete chunks, you create a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0of them which makes the choice problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calendars and scheduling everything doesn\u2019t work for me either, because:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are bad at predicting how long things will take to get done&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are bad at predicting the complexity or physical/mental energy things will take&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shit happens, and throws your schedule off and it has to be reworked&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are still staring at everything you have to do and with time pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Even though it seems the decisions of \u201cwhat to do when\u201d have been made, that\u2019s an illusion since you\u2019ll often have to redo all those \u00a0choices when something doesn\u2019t go according to plan.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One system that has worked for me somewhat is making a list the night before. \u00a0I usually list out urgent/important things, prioritize everything into a list and then put another piece of paper over everything except the top item. \u00a0Then the next day I wake up fresh, all the thinking and planning has been done the night before so it\u2019s not all cluttered in my head and I can\u2019t remember it all, and all I can see is the next task. \u00a0I trust that I\u2019ve got the most important/urgent thing first and give myself permission to let that be the only thing I do today. \u00a0Usually with that mentality I\u2019ve worked my way really far down that list and got a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not perfect though. \u00a0I don\u2019t always have the time to make a list every night. \u00a0Also, I still need to \u201cstore\u201d all my other projects and tasks, goals, someday/maybe stuff, etc somewhere. I haven\u2019t found the perfect system, but I\u2019m trying to think it through now with everything I\u2019ve learned that doesn\u2019t work, and WHY it doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s some things I\u2019ve found that make this so difficult:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any to do list you can have a bunch of tasks on it which differ in a number of important ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Emailing someone vs get new tires (note that can easily take more than an hour and can\u2019t be broken down into sub-tasks. \u00a0Other non-divisible tasks could take even longer.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgency:&lt;/strong&gt; A project due tomorrow vs something due in a month&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise vs checking out a tv show someone recommended\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical energy required:&lt;/strong&gt; Mow and rake the lawn vs research flights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental energy/focus required:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Study vs do laundry&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single task or part of larger goal:&lt;/strong&gt; \u00a0Even within larger goal, is it part of a larger goal that is completable (finishing a discrete project), or part of a larger goal with no end (even after you \u201cget fit\u201d you can\u2019t stop exercising - there\u2019s no end). \u00a0You could also call this \u201crecurring or step-by-step\u201d)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your current\u00a0\u201corbit\u201d or a someday/maybe wish:&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Some things you\u2019ve got on the brain and want to do currently, and others are just things you want to get out of your head and want to do but are on the back burner. \u00a0And things shift over time between the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest&lt;/strong&gt;: Some tasks you have a much greater desire to do than others and are willing to spend a lot more time and energy on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combine this with the reality that most of us are bad at predicting the time something will take, it\u2019s complexity, and/or how much energy it will require.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I so far haven\u2019t found a system that works to handle all of this complexity, and yet give me the ability to adjust the complexity of my view of my todo list to avoid overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are other complexities, such as the fact that most tasks have different combinations of these qualities and might therefore need to be dealt with differently. \u00a0Exercise is a recurring task that is part of a larger goal that has no end, requires lots of physical energy, is important but not urgent and should always be in your \u201corbit.\u201d \u00a0However, if it\u2019s a daily task, and it&amp;#39;s important to you, do you really need to put it on a to-do list? \u00a0It\u2019s more a part of a routine. \u00a0In that case some may suggest putting that in another app (system) like a habit tracker app. \u00a0But then you start to have a clutter of apps, because there are other things you need to keep track of that aren\u2019t even habits or tasks. \u00a0That show someone recommended to you, where do you store that? \u00a0it\u2019s more like a reminder, but for when? \u00a0There\u2019s no set time, it\u2019s more of a \u201cwhen i have free time.\u201d \u00a0Well thats inextricably linked to your todos because you should only be doing that, and ideally only reminded to do it, when you have things that are not more urgent or important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTaking out the trash\u201d is a discrete task that is short in duration, doesn\u2019t require much physical or mental energy, and isn\u2019t part of a larger goal\u2026 UNLESS you consider it part of \u201ccleaning your house.\u201d \u00a0Now, are you going to put a \u201cClean my House\u201d project and divide it into subcategories like \u201cKitchen\u201d \u201cLiving Room\u201d \u201cBathroom\u201d etc which are further broken down into tasks? \u00a0Seems a bit overkill. \u00a0Also this is a large project that happens to be both a discrete one with an end, and a recurring one with no end at the same time. You can get your whole house \u201cclean\u201d and be \u201cdone.\u201d \u00a0But eventually you have to do it all over again (but some parts of it more/less often than others!!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tasks may have more importance or urgency, but you might have a lot of resistance to doing, while others are much more interesting and are important (but less so). \u00a0Is your time better served procrastinating the more important/urgent items and end up not doing them at all or only doing a little, or getting a LOT done with the somewhat less important but more interesting tasks that you\u2019d rather do. \u00a0In the overall scheme of things, that might be better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there is the problem of even when you don\u2019t have things that are currently urgent, and you\u2019ve handled your most important tasks, you may have a whole bunch of possible things you can do which aren\u2019t necessarily more urgent/important than each other and you can choose any. \u00a0Having so much choice can lead to overwhelm and cause you to do nothing. \u00a0It\u2019s especially hard when some of these are not just discrete tasks but larger projects and you have limited time and have to choose wisely. \u00a0Your someday/maybe list is probably not pre-organized in any sort of a hierarchy that would allow you to limit your overwhelm of choice. \u00a0And even if it were, someday/maybe lists usually sit undisturbed for long periods of time, during which your priorities, interests, and circumstances usually change and shift so that prioritization might be obsolete by the time you look at it next in which case you now have to stuff your head with endless possibilities anyway since you\u2019d have to reprioritize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really have answers, but I do know what would work for me is a system vastly more simple, with less choice. \u00a0If there was some way to navigate all of this complexity and create a list that only shows you the best thing to do now and hides everything else, and adjusts as things change over time. \u00a0Maybe there could still be something like a \u201cweekly review\u201d where you take a look at everything, starting with the things that are most important to you in your life (and maybe just those things). \u00a0Automate as much as possible, focus on fewer, more important things, and do \u201cdeep work\u201d on them. \u00a0Take a particular project and just work on it in your spare time until it is done a day, week, or month later, and let other things that aren\u2019t strictly necessary get handled another time. \u00a0I am a fan of the &lt;strong&gt;consistent, daily action&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0approach as well, but I think it can easily get out of hand because people don\u2019t stick to one or two things, they start piling on multiple simultaneous projects (&amp;quot;Every morning I\u2019ll do 30min of programming practice, then 30min of learning photoshop, then 30min of reading, then 30min of X&amp;quot;, and on and on). \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s really all the other \u201cstuff\u201d and the organization and worry about it that is the problem, at least for me. \u00a0The more fully present you are, your mind completely free of any other tasks, deadlines, worries about whether the task you chose is the right one, the more you\u2019ll be able to focus and get things done. \u00a0\u201cDeep work\u201d helps with this (or larger chunks of \u201cconsistent, daily action\u201d) because there\u2019s no task-switching costs, you aren\u2019t constantly starting and stopping different, unrelated tasks and you can see faster progress which is motivating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of procrastination is probably just choice overwhelm and decision fatigue, along with an inability to be fully present because of worries about whether your choice of task was the correct one, or whether you\u2019ll get everything you have to get done done. \u00a0A lot of systems that tell you to break larger projects into smaller tasks are probably making decision fatigue much worse and making it harder for you to see progress because of the disconnect they create between the task and the bigger picture, along with the cost of task-switching and the lack of being able to build any momentum on anything. Projects are probably better handled by making hard choices about what\u2019s really important and then doing \u201cdeep work\u201d (see Cal Newport) on those projects, or taking a \u201cconsistent daily action\u201d approach on just a few things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: \u00a0Yes, I\u2019m aware every one\u2019s situation is different, some people have tons to do and lots of deadlines and spouses and children etc. \u00a0This is a given, so I\u2019m hoping everyone can use common sense and just use this info in whatever way can apply to their situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: formatting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It can be a commitment to your job, family, general/mental health, your side ventures or whatever else it can be. The chances are also that you often find yourself debating and thinking how much attention you should allocate to one or another area of your life, which often leads to an inconsistent approach and therefore inconsistent results.\n\nI am proposing you to take a scientific approach to yourself, discover your uniqueness, respect it and optimise the performance through **Flourish&amp;** framework. This framework aims to assist you in capturing your Values (e.g. family, health etc.) and distilling a transparent set of Actions you have to do day-in and day-out to achieve your Goals. Having an easy-to-use model for your daily life is critical to free up your mental bandwidth and let your energy focus on achieving things that matter and require that energy.\n\n# Introduction\n\nTo explain the key benefits of the framework and give you an upfront life example, let\u2019s have a look at a basic situation where this framework will step in.\n\nWe all have been there when you get back home from work and then you start thinking whether you should go to the gym or stay home and do some research for your side-venture and after some time of debating between the two, potentially ending up doing none of the two and feeling demotivated. What are the real negative impacts of this scenario?\n\nYou didn\u2019t do what you had to do to achieve your goals. You understand that to achieve your goals you will have to work for them, but how exactly do you achieve a goal like \u2019Be fit\u2019 or \u2018Be an entrepreneur\u2019? These are very general goals, yet these are the ones that we tend to have more often. The biggest challenge is the lack of clarity around how today can contribute to achieving these future general goals. But it shouldn\u2019t be this way and once you have clarity around your daily actions it becomes crystal clear what is it exactly you have to do to achieve your general goals. Also, on the discipline side of things, it gives you the direct price you will have to pay in the future for neglecting your actions today.\n\nHow this exercise will help? You will design a link between today and your general goals through a set of smaller Actions that you will do day-in and day-out, which will build up over time into the bigger general Goals that you have.\n\nYou have spent your valuable mental energy and time on debating what is it exactly that you should be doing that evening. That is also referred to as \u2018decision fatigue\u2019, which means that by the time you got home you already have done a handful of decisions throughout the day and the quality of future ones tends do go down. There is a proven record that as the day goes by, our decision budget is drained and the quality of such decisions deteriorates. The example I like the most is a study done on 1,112 judicial parole hearings. Among all factors that could have affected the result of the parole hearing (race, age, sex etc.) it was the time of the day that affected the outcome of the hearing the most. At the beginning of the day, the judges had the energy to make a positive decision, where 65% of the paroles were granted during the morning hearing. But as the day went by, the number has been steadily decreasing, but the convict cases have been the same as in the morning. That is because judges had less and less energy to flip the coin in the opposite direction.\n\nHow this exercise will help? You will have a personal roadmap to stick to daily eliminating the need of asking \u201cWhat I should do today to \u2018Be fit\u2019?\u201d and then doubting whether what you have done builds on what you have been doing previously and whether it brings you any closer to your Goal. These kinds of questions drain your mental energy, don\u2019t do it, you have better things to spend it on.\n\nYou have allowed the circumstances, which led up to your decision point, determine what you were going to do that evening. The example relatable to most of us is letting the day at work determine how the rest of the day will go. Of course, you should pay attention to your energy levels as sometimes we genuinely are drained from our day jobs, but remember how good you felt that day when you thought you just didn\u2019t have it in you and then still did it and felt awesome after? In simple terms, don\u2019t take the passenger seat, which means a lack of control. It\u2019s not the circumstances themselves that burn us out, it\u2019s the lack of control that is the problem.\n\nHow this exercise will help? Through sticking to the above-mentioned roadmap, you will maintain the control over your life and most importantly you will cultivate that feeling of control inside your mind. That feeling of control will make it easier for you to respond to the demands of life because you will know that you dictate how they affect you.\n\n# The Wheel of Wellbeing\n\nThe first step of having a well-balanced life lies not with activities or goals, but with working out elements your Wheel of wellbeing. Through answering a simple question \u2018What is important to you?\u2019 you are encouraged to work out a list of Values, which should be completely free from the pressure that society or your experience might put on you. This list is a very personal element of this framework and there are no expectations whatsoever about what it should or should not include (although I will put some examples below to give you an idea of the shape Values can have). This list will inevitably grow and change inline with you and it is normal to revisit your wheel and add or remove elements. In my experience, it took me more than several iterations until I got my wheel free from elements, which were expected from me rather than being deeply important to me.\n\nThe biggest advantage and benefit of having such list and making sure that your game is strong in every direction (more on that later) is that you naturally diversify your bets as you go along. Setbacks in life are a given and they will happen, however, they are most likely to be limited to one or two values on your list. First of all, knowing that some part of your life sucks but not the whole of it is a game-changer as it allows you to draw the energy from other well-performing values to get things right with the set-back. Second, we are the creatures of habit and there is scientific evidence to suggest that we perform better when surrounded by things that we are accustomed to. With a lack of balance, you tend to focus on a limited set of values, therefore exposing yourself to reduced performance should a change occur in the values in focus. Having a well-balanced lifestyle surrounds you with consistent habitual performance on all sides and digesting even a set of changes will not be a big deal or put your performance at risk.\n\n**Core Values**\n\nWe are all humans and getting our biology right underpins the journey to being a high-performer. Our biology is broken down into several Values, which together form a Core Values list. These are the Values that can be applied to every single one of us because they are at the core of human performance. The unique thing about Core Values is that these tend to give you the most grounding effect as you have the most control around them. These are the Values people most frequently tend to take energy from to fuel performance in other values.\n\nItems listed below are just examples, however, I highly recommend everyone to have them on her is his radar, even if just to spark some questions so that eventually you will consider adopting some of them.\n\n* General health\n* Physical activity\n* Biomechanics\n* Nutrition\n* Sleep &amp; Recovery\n* Mental energy\n\n**Other values**\n\nThis is the part, where you should ask yourself \u2018What is important to me?\u2019 and physically start scribbling down everything that comes to your mind. While doing so, try as hard as you can to ignore any outer pressure persuading you to feel strongly about something (like the list below, for example)\n\nSome examples of other Values:\n\n* Family\n* Relationship with children\n* Giving back to the community\n* Friends\n* Work\n* Side projects\n\n&gt;*Exercise*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Spend time on asking yourself \u2018What is important to me?\u2019 and capture on paper everything that comes to your mind. When you are finished, distil it into a set of values. Try to include only things that are important and exclude things that you think should be important. Sample output below does not mean that you are expected to have 12 values, I now have between 7 and 9 and I started with less. Acknowledge that this is a process.\n\n*Sample output*\n\n|*Value*|\n|:-|\n|General health|\n|Physical activity|\n|Biomechanics|\n|Nutrition|\n|Sleep &amp; Recovery|\n|Mental energy|\n|Family|\n|Relationship with children|\n|Giving back to the community|\n|Friends|\n|Work|\n|Side projects|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Goals**\n\nWe will now start to build upon your Values, so you must be comfortable with your current list of Values for now. For each Value, we will work out a Goal, which will represent your target state.\n\n&gt;*Exercise*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For each value, create a Value-Goal pair by asking yourself \u2018What is it I need to be/have to say that I am smashing it?\u2019. Try to be specific and avoid vague terms, however, it is acceptable to have goals, which sometimes will be hard to measure and will represent a 'state' rather than a 'result'. For example, one of my goals is to \u2018Be close with my daughter\u2019 and it\u2019s not something that I can measure, however through my Actions I am in the state with which I\u2019m comfortable.\n\n*Sample output*\n\n|*Value*|*Goal*|\n|:-|:-|\n|General health|Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to \\[X\\]|\n|Physical activity|Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press|\n|Biomechanics|Be able to reach my toes|\n|Nutrition|Reach weight/BMI of \\[X\\]|\n|Sleep &amp; Recovery|Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%|\n|Mental energy|Be mindful|\n|Family|Be close with my family|\n|Relationship with children|Be close with my children|\n|Giving back to the community|Fight homelessness|\n|Friends|Be in touch with my friends|\n|Side projects|Have my own business|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Activity**\n\nThroughout this exercise, you are carefully building up your framework based on your values. You are scientifically looking at your Values, analyse them, understand your Goals and now you will design the Activities, which will act as a connecting proxy between you and your goals.\n\nIn very simple terms, imagine you plan to buy a car in 2 years. You ask your bank for savings account interest rate and they calculate you a schedule of monthly deposits you will have to make each month over 2 years to reach your car goal. Having a clear schedule you have committed to, means you don\u2019t think every month - What do I do if I want to buy a car? Do I deposit in a savings account this month? Buy some bitcoin next month? Invest in shares next year? You come up with a realistic plan, do research and have faith in it. And if the plan was realistic and you have been faithful, you get to buy your car in 2 years. It\u2019s very similar to this framework.\n\n&gt;*Exercise*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For each Value-Goal pair, ask yourself \u2018What is it I need to do to reach my goal?'. The answers will vary based on goals and preferences, however, the rule is that you should be in a position to start the activity right away. For example, for your Goal 'Like what I see in the mirror', do not put 'Run a marathon' and instead assess your current state and do underlying research on what more feasible steps are, for example 'Go for a run 3 times a week'. Remember, it is fine to change the activities as you go as your preferences change.\n\n*Sample output*\n\n|*Value*|*Goal*|*Activity*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|General health|Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to \\[X\\]|Do an annual health check|\n|Physical activity|Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press|Go for a run 3 times a week|\n|Biomechanics|Be able to reach my toes|Do body stretching at least once a week|\n|Nutrition|Reach weight/BMI of \\[X\\]|Follow a plant-based diet|\n|Sleep &amp; Recovery|Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%|Sleep 8 hours a day|\n|Mental energy|Be mindful|Meditate everyday/weekend|\n|Family|Be close with my family|Call my parents at least every week|\n|Relationship with children|Be close with my children|Special time for me and my children every week|\n|Giving back to the community|Fight homelessness|Attend social service event at least every quarter|\n|Friends|Be in touch with my friends|Meet my friends at least every two weeks|\n|Side projects|Have my own business|Spend 2 hours on Project X every week|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tracking**\n\nDaily tracking is vital on the journey to better understanding your performance towards your goals and how your decisions and actions reflect on your progress. The benefit of daily tracking is that it can serve as a reminder about your statement, which is that you are at the centre of your life, your decisions have a direct impact on the quality of your future life and that you have the power to make changes now and see how it impacts your future.\n\nAs we have established already, you cannot run the risk of letting your daily activities fall into the hands of other people\u2019s will. A well thought through Values list should be designed, where you focus on things that matter to you the most and what your Goals look like. To achieve these goals, you establish a routine activity, something you do day-in and day-out because you know it will bring you to your goal. This is not about holding yourself accountable, you won\u2019t need it as you already believe in your Values and relevant Activities. This is about helping you shape the activity of your day to reflect your values, supporting you on days where you are confused or not sure what you should do. In other words - live life on *your* terms. And very important - get satisfaction from following simple steps daily as you know they bring you to your bigger ambitious Goals.\n\n&gt;*Exercise*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For each set of Value-Goal-Activity, ask yourself \u2018How often will I be tracking myself?\u2019. This can be daily for something you plan to do daily (such as daily sleep) or monthly (such as spend some quality time with your parents). Having defined the tracking frequency you will now need to review your daily activities daily, weekly activities weekly and so on. I have a weekly planner, where for each week I write out the things I want to do this week in bullet points and cross them off every day. For anything with a different frequency (like quarterly or yearly) I keep this in a separate place. If there is interest, I can share my layout, which is effortless.\n\n*Sample output*\n\n|*Value*|*Goal*|*Activity*|*Tracking*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|General health|Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to \\[X\\]|Do an annual health check|Annual|\n|Physical activity|Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press|Go for a run 3 times a week|Daily|\n|Biomechanics|Be able to reach my toes|Do body stretching at least once a week|Weekly|\n|Nutrition|Reach weight/BMI of \\[X\\]|Follow a plant-based diet|Daily|\n|Sleep &amp; Recovery|Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%|Sleep 8 hours a day|Daily|\n|Mental energy|Be mindful|Meditate everyday/weekend|Daily/Weekly|\n|Family|Be close with my family|Call my parents at least every week|Weekly|\n|Relationship with children|Be close with my children|Special time for me and my children every week|Weekly|\n|Giving back to the community|Fight homelessness|Attend social service event at least every quarter|Quarterly|\n|Friends|Be in touch with my friends|Meet my friends at least every two weeks|Semi-weekly|\n|Side projects|Have my own business|Spend 2 hours on Project X every week|Weekly|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Flexibility**\n\nOn the final note, I\u2019d like to share with you my lesson. This framework is designed to push-back on demands of the world around you, structure and tackle them in a balanced and organised way. Despite the focus being on pushing back on the world around, it can also put some pressure on you at times to keep you Goal-oriented, however, sometimes you will have to learn to be kind to yourself and don\u2019t shame yourself for missing an activity. If out of 5 days you miss your activities for 1 day, it\u2019s not that 1 day that matters, but these 4 where you have been faithful to your journey towards your Goals. Reflect on what went wrong, learn your lesson, don\u2019t dwell too much on it and move on.\n\nI am glad to share this framework with you guys and hope you will find it helpful on your journey to becoming a better and more productive person. Please share with me your comments and thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Formatting. Why is there no 'preview post' option?",

You will have a personal roadmap to stick to daily eliminating the need of asking \u201cWhat I should do today to \u2018Be fit\u2019?\u201d and then doubting whether what you have done builds on what you have been doing previously and whether it brings you any closer to your Goal. These kinds of questions drain your mental energy, don\u2019t do it, you have better things to spend it on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have allowed the circumstances, which led up to your decision point, determine what you were going to do that evening. The example relatable to most of us is letting the day at work determine how the rest of the day will go. Of course, you should pay attention to your energy levels as sometimes we genuinely are drained from our day jobs, but remember how good you felt that day when you thought you just didn\u2019t have it in you and then still did it and felt awesome after? In simple terms, don\u2019t take the passenger seat, which means a lack of control. It\u2019s not the circumstances themselves that burn us out, it\u2019s the lack of control that is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How this exercise will help? Through sticking to the above-mentioned roadmap, you will maintain the control over your life and most importantly you will cultivate that feeling of control inside your mind. That feeling of control will make it easier for you to respond to the demands of life because you will know that you dictate how they affect you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Wheel of Wellbeing&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first step of having a well-balanced life lies not with activities or goals, but with working out elements your Wheel of wellbeing. Through answering a simple question \u2018What is important to you?\u2019 you are encouraged to work out a list of Values, which should be completely free from the pressure that society or your experience might put on you. This list is a very personal element of this framework and there are no expectations whatsoever about what it should or should not include (although I will put some examples below to give you an idea of the shape Values can have). This list will inevitably grow and change inline with you and it is normal to revisit your wheel and add or remove elements. In my experience, it took me more than several iterations until I got my wheel free from elements, which were expected from me rather than being deeply important to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage and benefit of having such list and making sure that your game is strong in every direction (more on that later) is that you naturally diversify your bets as you go along. Setbacks in life are a given and they will happen, however, they are most likely to be limited to one or two values on your list. First of all, knowing that some part of your life sucks but not the whole of it is a game-changer as it allows you to draw the energy from other well-performing values to get things right with the set-back. Second, we are the creatures of habit and there is scientific evidence to suggest that we perform better when surrounded by things that we are accustomed to. With a lack of balance, you tend to focus on a limited set of values, therefore exposing yourself to reduced performance should a change occur in the values in focus. Having a well-balanced lifestyle surrounds you with consistent habitual performance on all sides and digesting even a set of changes will not be a big deal or put your performance at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are all humans and getting our biology right underpins the journey to being a high-performer. Our biology is broken down into several Values, which together form a Core Values list. These are the Values that can be applied to every single one of us because they are at the core of human performance. The unique thing about Core Values is that these tend to give you the most grounding effect as you have the most control around them. These are the Values people most frequently tend to take energy from to fuel performance in other values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Items listed below are just examples, however, I highly recommend everyone to have them on her is his radar, even if just to spark some questions so that eventually you will consider adopting some of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;General health&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Physical activity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Biomechanics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nutrition&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mental energy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the part, where you should ask yourself \u2018What is important to me?\u2019 and physically start scribbling down everything that comes to your mind. While doing so, try as hard as you can to ignore any outer pressure persuading you to feel strongly about something (like the list below, for example)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some examples of other Values:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Family&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relationship with children&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Giving back to the community&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Friends&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Side projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spend time on asking yourself \u2018What is important to me?\u2019 and capture on paper everything that comes to your mind. When you are finished, distil it into a set of values. Try to include only things that are important and exclude things that you think should be important. Sample output below does not mean that you are expected to have 12 values, I now have between 7 and 9 and I started with less. Acknowledge that this is a process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample output&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;General health&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Biomechanics&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Mental energy&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Relationship with children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Giving back to the community&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Work&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Side projects&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will now start to build upon your Values, so you must be comfortable with your current list of Values for now. For each Value, we will work out a Goal, which will represent your target state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For each value, create a Value-Goal pair by asking yourself \u2018What is it I need to be/have to say that I am smashing it?\u2019. Try to be specific and avoid vague terms, however, it is acceptable to have goals, which sometimes will be hard to measure and will represent a &amp;#39;state&amp;#39; rather than a &amp;#39;result&amp;#39;. For example, one of my goals is to \u2018Be close with my daughter\u2019 and it\u2019s not something that I can measure, however through my Actions I am in the state with which I\u2019m comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample output&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;General health&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Biomechanics&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be able to reach my toes&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Reach weight/BMI of [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Mental energy&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be mindful&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Relationship with children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Giving back to the community&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Fight homelessness&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in touch with my friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Side projects&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Have my own business&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout this exercise, you are carefully building up your framework based on your values. You are scientifically looking at your Values, analyse them, understand your Goals and now you will design the Activities, which will act as a connecting proxy between you and your goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In very simple terms, imagine you plan to buy a car in 2 years. You ask your bank for savings account interest rate and they calculate you a schedule of monthly deposits you will have to make each month over 2 years to reach your car goal. Having a clear schedule you have committed to, means you don\u2019t think every month - What do I do if I want to buy a car? Do I deposit in a savings account this month? Buy some bitcoin next month? Invest in shares next year? You come up with a realistic plan, do research and have faith in it. And if the plan was realistic and you have been faithful, you get to buy your car in 2 years. It\u2019s very similar to this framework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For each Value-Goal pair, ask yourself \u2018What is it I need to do to reach my goal?&amp;#39;. The answers will vary based on goals and preferences, however, the rule is that you should be in a position to start the activity right away. For example, for your Goal &amp;#39;Like what I see in the mirror&amp;#39;, do not put &amp;#39;Run a marathon&amp;#39; and instead assess your current state and do underlying research on what more feasible steps are, for example &amp;#39;Go for a run 3 times a week&amp;#39;. Remember, it is fine to change the activities as you go as your preferences change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample output&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;General health&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do an annual health check&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Go for a run 3 times a week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Biomechanics&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be able to reach my toes&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do body stretching at least once a week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Reach weight/BMI of [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Follow a plant-based diet&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep 8 hours a day&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Mental energy&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be mindful&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Meditate everyday/weekend&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Call my parents at least every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Relationship with children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Special time for me and my children every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Giving back to the community&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Fight homelessness&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Attend social service event at least every quarter&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in touch with my friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Meet my friends at least every two weeks&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Side projects&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Have my own business&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Spend 2 hours on Project X every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daily tracking is vital on the journey to better understanding your performance towards your goals and how your decisions and actions reflect on your progress. The benefit of daily tracking is that it can serve as a reminder about your statement, which is that you are at the centre of your life, your decisions have a direct impact on the quality of your future life and that you have the power to make changes now and see how it impacts your future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we have established already, you cannot run the risk of letting your daily activities fall into the hands of other people\u2019s will. A well thought through Values list should be designed, where you focus on things that matter to you the most and what your Goals look like. To achieve these goals, you establish a routine activity, something you do day-in and day-out because you know it will bring you to your goal. This is not about holding yourself accountable, you won\u2019t need it as you already believe in your Values and relevant Activities. This is about helping you shape the activity of your day to reflect your values, supporting you on days where you are confused or not sure what you should do. In other words - live life on &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; terms. And very important - get satisfaction from following simple steps daily as you know they bring you to your bigger ambitious Goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For each set of Value-Goal-Activity, ask yourself \u2018How often will I be tracking myself?\u2019. This can be daily for something you plan to do daily (such as daily sleep) or monthly (such as spend some quality time with your parents). Having defined the tracking frequency you will now need to review your daily activities daily, weekly activities weekly and so on. I have a weekly planner, where for each week I write out the things I want to do this week in bullet points and cross them off every day. For anything with a different frequency (like quarterly or yearly) I keep this in a separate place. If there is interest, I can share my layout, which is effortless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample output&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;General health&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in a healthy state / Lower my cholesterol to [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do an annual health check&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Annual&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Like what I see in the mirror / Do 100kg in Bench-press&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Go for a run 3 times a week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Daily&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Biomechanics&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be able to reach my toes&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do body stretching at least once a week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Reach weight/BMI of [X]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Follow a plant-based diet&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Daily&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lower number of mental breakdowns by 10%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sleep 8 hours a day&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Daily&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Mental energy&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be mindful&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Meditate everyday/weekend&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Daily/Weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my family&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Call my parents at least every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Relationship with children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be close with my children&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Special time for me and my children every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Giving back to the community&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Fight homelessness&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Attend social service event at least every quarter&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Quarterly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Be in touch with my friends&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Meet my friends at least every two weeks&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Semi-weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Side projects&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Have my own business&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Spend 2 hours on Project X every week&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Weekly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the final note, I\u2019d like to share with you my lesson. This framework is designed to push-back on demands of the world around you, structure and tackle them in a balanced and organised way. Despite the focus being on pushing back on the world around, it can also put some pressure on you at times to keep you Goal-oriented, however, sometimes you will have to learn to be kind to yourself and don\u2019t shame yourself for missing an activity. If out of 5 days you miss your activities for 1 day, it\u2019s not that 1 day that matters, but these 4 where you have been faithful to your journey towards your Goals. Reflect on what went wrong, learn your lesson, don\u2019t dwell too much on it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am glad to share this framework with you guys and hope you will find it helpful on your journey to becoming a better and more productive person. Please share with me your comments and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Formatting.

It often feels like there's no time \"for me\".\n\nBut the more I thought about it, I discovered another reason: students don't get decision fatigue.\n\nAs an adult I have to decide what to do, where to do, when to do it, and how to get there. I mean this in a literal and metaphorical sense. We're supposed to take care of our basic needs, sometimes those of others, maintain our home and health, manage our expenses and at the same time be pursuing our \"life purpose\".\n\nIn retrospect, my life as a student was easy.\n\nAnd so I've been brainstorming ways to decrease decision fatigue and increase structure. And so far, it's working well. In the few ways I've implemented this, I feel more relaxed and confident. It helps me feel more like an adult and less like a grown child feeling her way around in the dark.\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n* **Making a food schedule.** This has been a huge help for me. Each Sunday, I write a weekly schedule with breakfast, lunch and dinner, and proceed to fill it up with meals. At first I didn't even pay attention to how healthy, affordable or tasty they were. The goal was simply to fill the schedule with 21 meals. Now that I've been doing it for a while, I can spend more time nit-picking what types of meals I want for the week. But overall, it's helped to relieve a lot of stress surrounding grocery shopping, meal planning &amp; prepping, and expenses.\n* **Time management.** I've been a procrastinator my whole life. I could spend an entire day surfing the web and watching movies instead of being productive. But by the end of the day I'll feel like I wasted my day twice - once in feeling guilty and twice in not accomplishing anything. And so I've started scheduling what needs to be done, especially re-occurring things like cleaning, working, sorting mail. And I've found it works very well if I pick the same time each morning to do it, 9 AM for example. Maybe on Monday I'm doing one thing at 9AM, on Tuesday I'm doing another, on Wednesday another, but after a few weeks, I have this strong association with 9AM and productivity. This ensures that I *want* to be productive at 9AM, because that's what I'm used to.\n* **Grading myself.** There's no teacher to tell me how well I'm doing, and so I've taken to grading myself. Last year, I created an inventory of all the personality traits I want to have. For each trait, I graded myself from 0 - 10. When I was done, I looked at the lowest traits and decided which one I wanted to improve. I then created a plan for improving that trait, and incorporated that into my schedule. Every couple months I would re-grade myself to see how I did. It's been extremely rewarding.\n\nHow about you? Do you miss the structure of school, or do enjoy the freedom of adulthood?",

                    "selftext": "I finished reading The Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. In the book, she explores her method for decluttering the homes of thousands of messy clients around the world. She champions counterintuitive organizational methods.\n\n\n**Why bother decluttering?**\nKondo argues that our possessions are the physical artifacts of our decisions. Thus, a messy room indicates that our minds are disorganized. The state of our belongings is a reminder of what we value and plan to maintain. Ordering the home helps us order our lives. It helps us focus on the objects and thoughts that matter most to us. It helps us reduce decision fatigue and streamline our priorities.\n\n**Declutter once and for all**\nBecause clutter begets clutter in mindset and in physical order, Kondo recommends tidying everything in one big session. She has observed in her organizational consulting career that gradual decluttering leads to frustration. For details on why, grab the book. The theme of batch processing of organization comes up in several places. You don\u2019t have to do it all in one day, but this should be done over the course of a week or two. Envision what you want your home to look like.\n\n**How to attack the clutter**\nLay out all your belongings in categories. Each respective category should be laid out in it\u2019s own respective open space in your house. You won\u2019t be moving your objects from one meta-hoarding space to another.\n\nDiscard what you don\u2019t need first. Her method for choosing what to discard sounds hokey. But, it seems to work for me. Hold each object in your hands and note how it makes you feel. Do you love this object? Does it bring you joy? Do you feel guilt about it? Do you fear losing it would effect your future? Do you fear you\u2019ll be disrespecting a family member or your own memories by discarding it? If you want to create your home as a joyful and guilt-free place, the objects in it should be thoughtfully chosen to evoke these feelings. How does it feel to walk into your living room and think: \u201cI wish I could get a new TV, but my cousin was so nice to fix this one for me, I couldn\u2019t get a new one.\u201d Do you really think you\u2019re cousin would be happy to know you\u2019re not getting the TV you want because they fixed it? If an item doesn\u2019t bring you joy or a sense of wholeness, get rid of it. Don\u2019t dump it on another family member, don\u2019t store it for future use. Get rid of it.\n\n**The Decluttering Order**\nKondo specifies an order to discarding things, ordered from easiest to hardest to discard.\n\nClothes\n\nBooks\n\nDiscard everything but the books you love keeping and the ones you are reading. Don\u2019t keep around books you\u2019ll \u201cread someday\u201d. The time to read a book is within a couple months of attaining it.\nPapers\n\nDiscard all except items you are\nUsing now\nNeed for a short time\nNeed forever\nKeep them all in the same place.\nDiscard manuals, keep warranties (until they expire.)\nMiscellaneous\n\nDiscard product boxes, you rarely need them.\nThrow away excess cords and spare items.\nDiscard health craze items (ab roller, weight loss machine, etc).\nMementos/Photos/Nostalgic Items\n\nThis is difficult, but important, because it helps us come to terms with our past and keep it where it belongs (behind us.) Our space should reflect and amplify who we are, not who we were.\n\n**Storage**\nKondo doesn\u2019t like storage. In a contemporary society with Amazon and local stores, it is unneeded. Regardless, some things are prudent to keep around. They are best kept in closets out of the way (mentally and physically). Similar items should be kept together (clothes with cloths, electronics with electronics, etc\u2026) They should be ordered vertically so each item can be easily picked from the storage area without having to dig through a stack or pile.\n\n\nOffseason items can go on top of shelves.\n\nHang sponges so they dry out. Keep bathroom items out of the tub area so they stay dry and don\u2019t collect scum.\n\nKeep items off the kitchen counter. This is a space for food preparation.\n\nRemove words on items showing words. They bring \u201cnoise\u201d to an area. Get the book for a deeper discussion as to why this is.\n\nBags can go inside each other to maximize space.\n\n**Specific advice on clothing storage and folding**\nThe book has some important tips on storing and folding various types of clothing. Keep your clothes vertically folded and standing next to each other. Not stacked. You\u2019ll have to watch videos for a better explanation.  Everything gets folded and placed into drawers in your closet unless that is impractical as is the case with coats, jackets, skirts, suits, dresses, and some pants. Socks never get balled up (and stretched out.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**When are you done?**\nWhen you feel like your space clicks and doesn\u2019t have any excess objects. This is purely qualitative. Kondo finds applying metrics only upsets people and leaves us feeling out of touch with the process of having the space the way we want it.\n\n**When to stop the decluttering**\nEvery item will have its place in a room. It will be simple and natural to return it to that place when you are done with it. The items left after the declutter will feel important and worth treating well. It will naturally be easier for things to have a place, when there are fewer items vying for places.\n\nHer clients show more respect for their belongings and feel a deeper sense of gratitude for them. They come to an understanding of what they value. They learn to let go of physical possessions that are holding them back.\n\n**The Magic of Tidying Up**\nThe book was on my list for a while because it\u2019s at the top of Amazon organization lists and I have a fascination with optimizing space. Programmatic organization first interested me last year when an NPR show pointed me to a book on personal organization by a computer scientist. The Magic of Tidying Up was one of my favorite reads of all time. I definitely recommend you get the book for a more rigorous  examination of the ideas explored here.\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been striving to live in a more simple environment. I\u2019ve been purging belongings I don\u2019t need. As Kondo mentions in her book, our fear of needing things is overblown. I can\u2019t even remember the things I\u2019ve discarded. And I notice that my mind is freed up to think about the tasks and thoughts I want to focus on, rather than on the clutter of objects in my space. Having a messy space means constantly being physically reminded by the objects around you \u201cwhere does this go?\u201d \u201cwhat should I do with that?\u201d \u201cI should address this thing on this paper\u201d. Clutter begets clutter in the mind and the world. I think it\u2019s good to have things and think about the things in your physical space. But, these things should be thoughtfully ordered such that your mind is focusing on the things that bring you joy and fulfillment; the things that order your life to the production of the tasks that move you to your goals, whatever they may be. Are their objects in your space, on your desk or in your drawers, or on your floor, bring mild discontentment into your life?

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished reading The Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. In the book, she explores her method for decluttering the homes of thousands of messy clients around the world. She champions counterintuitive organizational methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why bother decluttering?&lt;/strong&gt;\nKondo argues that our possessions are the physical artifacts of our decisions. Thus, a messy room indicates that our minds are disorganized. The state of our belongings is a reminder of what we value and plan to maintain. Ordering the home helps us order our lives. It helps us focus on the objects and thoughts that matter most to us. It helps us reduce decision fatigue and streamline our priorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declutter once and for all&lt;/strong&gt;\nBecause clutter begets clutter in mindset and in physical order, Kondo recommends tidying everything in one big session. She has observed in her organizational consulting career that gradual decluttering leads to frustration. For details on why, grab the book. The theme of batch processing of organization comes up in several places. You don\u2019t have to do it all in one day, but this should be done over the course of a week or two. Envision what you want your home to look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to attack the clutter&lt;/strong&gt;\nLay out all your belongings in categories. Each respective category should be laid out in it\u2019s own respective open space in your house. You won\u2019t be moving your objects from one meta-hoarding space to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discard what you don\u2019t need first. Her method for choosing what to discard sounds hokey. But, it seems to work for me. Hold each object in your hands and note how it makes you feel. Do you love this object? Does it bring you joy? Do you feel guilt about it? Do you fear losing it would effect your future? Do you fear you\u2019ll be disrespecting a family member or your own memories by discarding it? If you want to create your home as a joyful and guilt-free place, the objects in it should be thoughtfully chosen to evoke these feelings. How does it feel to walk into your living room and think: \u201cI wish I could get a new TV, but my cousin was so nice to fix this one for me, I couldn\u2019t get a new one.\u201d Do you really think you\u2019re cousin would be happy to know you\u2019re not getting the TV you want because they fixed it? If an item doesn\u2019t bring you joy or a sense of wholeness, get rid of it. Don\u2019t dump it on another family member, don\u2019t store it for future use. Get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Decluttering Order&lt;/strong&gt;\nKondo specifies an order to discarding things, ordered from easiest to hardest to discard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clothes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Books&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discard everything but the books you love keeping and the ones you are reading. Don\u2019t keep around books you\u2019ll \u201cread someday\u201d. The time to read a book is within a couple months of attaining it.\nPapers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discard all except items you are\nUsing now\nNeed for a short time\nNeed forever\nKeep them all in the same place.\nDiscard manuals, keep warranties (until they expire.)\nMiscellaneous&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discard product boxes, you rarely need them.\nThrow away excess cords and spare items.\nDiscard health craze items (ab roller, weight loss machine, etc).\nMementos/Photos/Nostalgic Items&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is difficult, but important, because it helps us come to terms with our past and keep it where it belongs (behind us.) Our space should reflect and amplify who we are, not who we were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;\nKondo doesn\u2019t like storage. In a contemporary society with Amazon and local stores, it is unneeded. Regardless, some things are prudent to keep around. They are best kept in closets out of the way (mentally and physically). Similar items should be kept together (clothes with cloths, electronics with electronics, etc\u2026) They should be ordered vertically so each item can be easily picked from the storage area without having to dig through a stack or pile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offseason items can go on top of shelves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hang sponges so they dry out. Keep bathroom items out of the tub area so they stay dry and don\u2019t collect scum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep items off the kitchen counter. This is a space for food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove words on items showing words. They bring \u201cnoise\u201d to an area. Get the book for a deeper discussion as to why this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bags can go inside each other to maximize space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific advice on clothing storage and folding&lt;/strong&gt;\nThe book has some important tips on storing and folding various types of clothing. Keep your clothes vertically folded and standing next to each other. Not stacked. You\u2019ll have to watch videos for a better explanation.  Everything gets folded and placed into drawers in your closet unless that is impractical as is the case with coats, jackets, skirts, suits, dresses, and some pants. Socks never get balled up (and stretched out.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When are you done?&lt;/strong&gt;\nWhen you feel like your space clicks and doesn\u2019t have any excess objects. This is purely qualitative. Kondo finds applying metrics only upsets people and leaves us feeling out of touch with the process of having the space the way we want it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to stop the decluttering&lt;/strong&gt;\nEvery item will have its place in a room. It will be simple and natural to return it to that place when you are done with it. The items left after the declutter will feel important and worth treating well. It will naturally be easier for things to have a place, when there are fewer items vying for places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her clients show more respect for their belongings and feel a deeper sense of gratitude for them. They come to an understanding of what they value. They learn to let go of physical possessions that are holding them back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/strong&gt;\nThe book was on my list for a while because it\u2019s at the top of Amazon organization lists and I have a fascination with optimizing space. Programmatic organization first interested me last year when an NPR show pointed me to a book on personal organization by a computer scientist. The Magic of Tidying Up was one of my favorite reads of all time. I definitely recommend you get the book for a more rigorous  examination of the ideas explored here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been striving to live in a more simple environment. I\u2019ve been purging belongings I don\u2019t need. As Kondo mentions in her book, our fear of needing things is overblown. I can\u2019t even remember the things I\u2019ve discarded. And I notice that my mind is freed up to think about the tasks and thoughts I want to focus on, rather than on the clutter of objects in my space. Having a messy space means constantly being physically reminded by the objects around you \u201cwhere does this go?\u201d \u201cwhat should I do with that?\u201d \u201cI should address this thing on this paper\u201d. Clutter begets clutter in the mind and the world. I think it\u2019s good to have things and think about the things in your physical space. But, these things should be thoughtfully ordered such that your mind is focusing on the things that bring you joy and fulfillment; the things that order your life to the production of the tasks that move you to your goals, whatever they may be. Are their objects in your space, on your desk or in your drawers, or on your floor, bring mild discontentment into your life? If you\u2019re OK with that, ask why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See more of my writeups on productivity at theoptimizednow.com&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm new to this community, and am thinking about starting a website discussing how people who work office jobs can leverage principles of performance psychology to do better at work while spending less time in the office.\n\nI wrote the below piece and would welcome feedback. I'd love to create and share more content like this with the community if you think it's useful. \n\n___\n\n**Why the President wears the same thing every day, and what that can tell you about how to improve performance at work**\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair in 2012, Barack Obama raised eyebrows when he admitted to wearing the same two suits every day at work. \u201cI\u2019m trying to pare down decisions\u201d said Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first accomplished figure to adopt a minimalist dress code; Steve Jobs was notorious for sporting his famous black turtleneck and jeans get-up for his keynotes, and Mark Zuckerberg wears the same t-shirt every day. \n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? What possible advantage could there be in wearing the same thing every day?\n\n**Decision fatigue - a hidden force that saps your willpower and intelligence**\n\nIn structuring their days, both Obama and Zuckerberg recognize the pernicious effects of decision fatigue. Recent research has shown that repeatedly making decisions throughout the day drains our willpower, sucks away energy, and makes us worse at making subsequent decisions. \n\nSuspecting a relationship between decision making and willpower, researchers conducted an experiment measuring how long students would be able to hold their hands in a freezing bucket of ice water (the things students will do for extra beer money). Those in the control group lasted an average of 67 seconds; those in the experimental group, who were barraged with a series of inconsequential decisions to make beforehand, lasted less than HALF that. The results of the experiment were crystal clear - decision making has a massive impact on willpower.\n\nMore alarmingly, decision making also impacts the quality of future decisions later in the day. In an analysis of the parole decisions made by Israeli judges, researchers found that the judges were seven times less likely to extend a parole offer to prisoners seen in the late afternoon than in the morning. All of the \u201cdeciding\u201d throughout the day taxed their ability to make clear, thoughtful decisions, making them significantly more likely to defer to the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and deny parole at the end of the day. \n\n**What you can do to counteract the effects of decision fatigue**\n\nDecisions are central to the day-to-day for anybody working in an office, some minor (\u201cWhere should we go for lunch today?\u201d), some major (\u201cHow should we allocate budget next year?\u201d). And we are all reliant on the willpower that decision-making saps in order to power through our to-do lists. \n\nUnfortunately, just like how nobody has an infinite supply of willpower or energy, there\u2019s no way you can completely eliminate decision fatigue from your work life. Thankfully, there are a number of ways that decision fatigue can be intelligently managed so that its effects are minimized. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s worked best for me , and what\u2019s backed by the science.\n\n**1. Minimize the number of decisions you have to make**\n\nAs crazy as it may sound, there\u2019s a lot we can do to reduce the number of decisions we need to make in our work day. \n\nThink about it - I bet that this morning you didn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to brush your teeth. You just did it (hopefully). Bringing a similar level of automaticity and ritual to other actions throughout your work day can significantly reduce the impact of decision fatigue.\n\nTo illustrate, here are some of the things I\u2019ve found helpful to systematize and automate to reduce decision burden:\n\nMy morning ritual - when to wake up, what to eat for breakfast, what to wear, when to leave for work\n\nCommuting - what route to take, what emails to read on the train, what podcasts to listen to\n\nPlanning - when to plan out the day, set meetings, how to organize and prioritize what needs to be done\n\nLunch - when to take my break, where to eat, what to order\n\nEmailing - When to check emails, how to sort and triage my emails to be more efficient\n\nWriting - how to structure an email or article, how much time to spend drafting vs. editing\n\nThe more of your day you can systematize and automate, the more you can insulate yourself against the effects of decision fatigue.\n\n**2. Take care of yourself**\n\nNo surprise - getting a good night\u2019s sleep and eating healthy play a major role in staving off decision fatigue. Let\u2019s look at each in a bit more detail.\n\nThe power of a good night\u2019s sleep\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that sleep confers massive performance benefits, and it\u2019s no different when it comes to decision fatigue. In a study of critical care nurses published in the American Journal of Critical Care, researchers identified a strong correlation between nurses feeling \u201cdecision regret,\u201d a feeling that they made the wrong clinical decision, and lower sleep quality. \n\nTo mitigate the negative impacts of decision fatigue, you simply must get a good night\u2019s sleep. What qualifies as a \u201cgood night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Personally, I try and shoot for at least 7.5 hours a night. Is that always realistic? Of course not! But if you can make a sleep a priority, and get as close as is reasonable to 8 hours a day, your brain will be be much more prepared to fight decision fatigue off.\n\nAnd one more thing - if you\u2019ve got a really important decision to make, don\u2019t be afraid to sleep on it! You would never make an important decision without doing everything in your power to make sure it\u2019s the correct one. So why would you make a key decision while exhausted at the end of the day, or on a poor night\u2019s sleep? It\u2019s almost always better to wait that extra day to ensure you\u2019re making the right decision.\n\nEat to recharge your \u201cdecision muscle\u201d\n\nRemember those Israeli judges? It turns out that while prisoners tended to fare much worse off later in the day, those seen right after the judges ate lunch proved the exception to the rule. It turns out that glucose has a replenishing effect on the parts of the brain that are depleted by decision-making. \n\nThe take-away: don\u2019t make decisions on an empty stomach, and make sure to try and get something to eat at least once every few hours while you\u2019re in the office. However, before you reach for the cookie jar... know that high-glucose foods like sweets and candies will only confer a temporary spike in glucose, and that you\u2019ll be much better off with low glycemic effect foods (think high protein, low carb) that release a steady, longer lasting stream of glucose. \n\nPersonally, I like to combine this tip with the one above by ordering the same healthy meal every day for lunch (chicken burrito bowl, no rice, extra guac), which has the dual effect of removing extraneous decisions from my day, and and recharging my mind for the afternoon and evening. \n\n**3. Structure your day with decision fatigue in mind**\n\nRealistically, even in a best case scenario, you\u2019ll be suffering from decision fatigue to some extent by the latter part of the day. Personally, my brain turns into a mush at about 5 or 530. Because of this, I\u2019ve found that when I schedule my most challenging, high-impact to-dos early in the morning rather than at the end of the day, I perform at a MUCH higher level. \n\nHere\u2019s a simple exercise you can try to apply this to your own job:\n\nAt the beginning of your day, write down a list of the most important things that you want to get done.\n\nOrder those items from hardest to easiest\n\nExecute on those items in that order \n\nBy the late afternoon or early evening, when decision fatigue is at it\u2019s peak, you\u2019ll have finished your most challenging tasks, and still be fully capable of knocking out the easier, lower-stakes tasks that you\u2019ve saved for the end of the day. \n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that it\u2019s not always realistic to follow this to the letter - there are meetings that you can\u2019t move, client fire drills, and project deadlines that conspire to throw off this type of planning. But by applying this exercise to the parts of your work that you can control, you\u2019ll still be way ahead of the game.\n\n\n",

I&amp;#39;d love to create and share more content like this with the community if you think it&amp;#39;s useful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the President wears the same thing every day, and what that can tell you about how to improve performance at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2012, Barack Obama raised eyebrows when he admitted to wearing the same two suits every day at work. \u201cI\u2019m trying to pare down decisions\u201d said Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wouldn\u2019t be the first accomplished figure to adopt a minimalist dress code; Steve Jobs was notorious for sporting his famous black turtleneck and jeans get-up for his keynotes, and Mark Zuckerberg wears the same t-shirt every day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s going on here? What possible advantage could there be in wearing the same thing every day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision fatigue - a hidden force that saps your willpower and intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In structuring their days, both Obama and Zuckerberg recognize the pernicious effects of decision fatigue. Recent research has shown that repeatedly making decisions throughout the day drains our willpower, sucks away energy, and makes us worse at making subsequent decisions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suspecting a relationship between decision making and willpower, researchers conducted an experiment measuring how long students would be able to hold their hands in a freezing bucket of ice water (the things students will do for extra beer money). Those in the control group lasted an average of 67 seconds; those in the experimental group, who were barraged with a series of inconsequential decisions to make beforehand, lasted less than HALF that. The results of the experiment were crystal clear - decision making has a massive impact on willpower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, decision making also impacts the quality of future decisions later in the day. In an analysis of the parole decisions made by Israeli judges, researchers found that the judges were seven times less likely to extend a parole offer to prisoners seen in the late afternoon than in the morning. All of the \u201cdeciding\u201d throughout the day taxed their ability to make clear, thoughtful decisions, making them significantly more likely to defer to the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and deny parole at the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do to counteract the effects of decision fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decisions are central to the day-to-day for anybody working in an office, some minor (\u201cWhere should we go for lunch today?\u201d), some major (\u201cHow should we allocate budget next year?\u201d). And we are all reliant on the willpower that decision-making saps in order to power through our to-do lists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, just like how nobody has an infinite supply of willpower or energy, there\u2019s no way you can completely eliminate decision fatigue from your work life. Thankfully, there are a number of ways that decision fatigue can be intelligently managed so that its effects are minimized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what\u2019s worked best for me , and what\u2019s backed by the science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Minimize the number of decisions you have to make&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As crazy as it may sound, there\u2019s a lot we can do to reduce the number of decisions we need to make in our work day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it - I bet that this morning you didn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to brush your teeth. You just did it (hopefully). Bringing a similar level of automaticity and ritual to other actions throughout your work day can significantly reduce the impact of decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, here are some of the things I\u2019ve found helpful to systematize and automate to reduce decision burden:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My morning ritual - when to wake up, what to eat for breakfast, what to wear, when to leave for work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Commuting - what route to take, what emails to read on the train, what podcasts to listen to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planning - when to plan out the day, set meetings, how to organize and prioritize what needs to be done&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch - when to take my break, where to eat, what to order&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emailing - When to check emails, how to sort and triage my emails to be more efficient&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Writing - how to structure an email or article, how much time to spend drafting vs. editing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more of your day you can systematize and automate, the more you can insulate yourself against the effects of decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Take care of yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No surprise - getting a good night\u2019s sleep and eating healthy play a major role in staving off decision fatigue. Let\u2019s look at each in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power of a good night\u2019s sleep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s no secret that sleep confers massive performance benefits, and it\u2019s no different when it comes to decision fatigue. In a study of critical care nurses published in the American Journal of Critical Care, researchers identified a strong correlation between nurses feeling \u201cdecision regret,\u201d a feeling that they made the wrong clinical decision, and lower sleep quality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the negative impacts of decision fatigue, you simply must get a good night\u2019s sleep. What qualifies as a \u201cgood night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Personally, I try and shoot for at least 7.5 hours a night. Is that always realistic? Of course not! But if you can make a sleep a priority, and get as close as is reasonable to 8 hours a day, your brain will be be much more prepared to fight decision fatigue off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one more thing - if you\u2019ve got a really important decision to make, don\u2019t be afraid to sleep on it! You would never make an important decision without doing everything in your power to make sure it\u2019s the correct one. So why would you make a key decision while exhausted at the end of the day, or on a poor night\u2019s sleep? It\u2019s almost always better to wait that extra day to ensure you\u2019re making the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat to recharge your \u201cdecision muscle\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember those Israeli judges? It turns out that while prisoners tended to fare much worse off later in the day, those seen right after the judges ate lunch proved the exception to the rule. It turns out that glucose has a replenishing effect on the parts of the brain that are depleted by decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The take-away: don\u2019t make decisions on an empty stomach, and make sure to try and get something to eat at least once every few hours while you\u2019re in the office. However, before you reach for the cookie jar... know that high-glucose foods like sweets and candies will only confer a temporary spike in glucose, and that you\u2019ll be much better off with low glycemic effect foods (think high protein, low carb) that release a steady, longer lasting stream of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to combine this tip with the one above by ordering the same healthy meal every day for lunch (chicken burrito bowl, no rice, extra guac), which has the dual effect of removing extraneous decisions from my day, and and recharging my mind for the afternoon and evening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Structure your day with decision fatigue in mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realistically, even in a best case scenario, you\u2019ll be suffering from decision fatigue to some extent by the latter part of the day. Personally, my brain turns into a mush at about 5 or 530. Because of this, I\u2019ve found that when I schedule my most challenging, high-impact to-dos early in the morning rather than at the end of the day, I perform at a MUCH higher level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a simple exercise you can try to apply this to your own job:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of your day, write down a list of the most important things that you want to get done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Order those items from hardest to easiest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Execute on those items in that order &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the late afternoon or early evening, when decision fatigue is at it\u2019s peak, you\u2019ll have finished your most challenging tasks, and still be fully capable of knocking out the easier, lower-stakes tasks that you\u2019ve saved for the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll be the first to admit that it\u2019s not always realistic to follow this to the letter - there are meetings that you can\u2019t move, client fire drills, and project deadlines that conspire to throw off this type of planning. But by applying this exercise to the parts of your work that you can control, you\u2019ll still be way ahead of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

While we don\u2019t always realize it, as we breeze (or slog) through our working days, we make countless decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which email should you reply to first?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should you take care of this now or after lunch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason that we get tired at around 3pm isn\u2019t just because our body is diverting energy from the brain to the stomach as it tries to digest your lunch, but also because we have decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We take the path of least resistance. Things we would usually have given thought to, we dismiss. Judges are well documented when it comes to decision fatigue, and since our decisions might not be as impactful or obvious as a choice to send someone to prison for life, it\u2019s still a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution to overcoming decision fatigue comes in a strange form.

                    "selftext": "What did you do when you woke up this morning?\nHow did you feel?\nWas it the same routine you had yesterday?\n\nOn average, each of us wake up to 25,000 mornings in our adult life, which means we have 25,000 days to maximize how we spend it.\n\nYour morning defines the rest of your day. \n\nIf you can optimize your morning routines, you\u2019ve set yourself up to have a productive day ahead of you.\n\nThe good news is, we all wake up with a fresh slate each morning, and have the opportunity to make it a great one, no matter how unproductive your previous mornings have been.\n\nBefore we dig into how to optimize your morning routines, let\u2019s debunk some of the big myths out there\nMyth #1: The infamous snooze button\n\nEven before the rise of smartphone alarms, you\u2019ve probably waken up through the sound of an alarm clock most of your life.\n\nOur body has learned to hate the dreaded alarm clock sound because it prevents us from getting what we want most, when we need it most: sleep.\n\nSo what do most of us do immediately? Hit the snooze button.\n\nStudies have shown that we do this because our body releases serotonin into our bloodstream when we sleep, which is a neurotransmitter associated with happiness.\n\nIn fact, humans as species are not used to being woken up from artificial noise, as we woke up naturally throughout evolution.\n\nDespite how satisfied we may feel hitting the snooze button to sneak in that extra 10 minutes of sleep, it\u2019s actually doing us more harm.\n\nThe reason is because when we return to sleep, our body pumps out dopamine, a chemical that suppresses feelings of sleepiness. As a result, our body is chemically pulled in both directions, leaving us disorientated and groggy.\nMyth #2: Depending on rewards alone\n\nWe often use rewards to motivate ourselves to do something.\n\nThink about the infamous sit-up routine in exchange of a chocolate cake as the reward.\n\nAlthough rewards are an important part of the equation, it\u2019s not the entire picture.\n\nIn the book Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg claims that you can\u2019t rely on rewards to get that habit to stick. It\u2019s a whole system, which he calls the habit loop.\n\nfeedback loop\n\nFor example, if you want to rid the habit of waking up late, you need to start by identifying the cue that is causing the habit in the first place.\n\n    Is it the dreaded thought of choosing which outfit you need to wear?\n    Perhaps it\u2019s the effort of making breakfast before you rush off to work.\n\nDuhigg suggests that cues fall into five categories:\n\nLocation, time, emotional state, other people, and immediately preceding action.\n\nThe key is to isolate your cravings and reward, so you can replace your bad habit with something good.\n\nFor example, instead of hitting the snooze button and falling back to sleep, you could reward yourself with a hot cup of coffee. The cue could be as simple as the smell of coffee, which you can ask your roommate to brew every morning.\nMyth #3: All strategies work for everyone\n\nThere is no one size fits all with establishing morning habits that fits us best. The average adult needs 7\u20139 hours of sleep, yet some of us only need 6 hours, while others need 10.\n\nIn addition, some of us have to shower in the morning to wake ourselves up, while some of us only need a cup of coffee to get going.\n\nIn her book Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives, Gretchen Rubin suggests most of us fall into one of four different general categories with regards to motivation:\n\n    Upholders respond readily to both outer expectations and inner expectations.\n    Questioners question all expectations, and will meet an expectation only if they believe it\u2019s justified.\n    Obligers respond readily to outer expectations but struggle to meet inner expectations.\n    Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike.\n\nKnowing which category you fall into can help you best navigate how you should form your new habits moving forward.\nIn fact, it\u2019s also helpful in navigating which advice you should follow, and which to ignore.\n\nGretchen has a short quiz you can take to know which of these groups you belong to. It\u2019s pretty fascinating, not going to lie!\n\nNow let\u2019s get on to what you can do to form powerful morning routines to increase productivity.\n1. Wake up next to natural light\n\nA study was done on a group of adults suffering from sleep deprivation, where they embarked on a week long camping trip. And the results were shocking.\n\nIn just a few days living in absence of artificial light and alarm clocks, the participants not only had an easier time falling sleep, but they also had an easier time waking up. The sleep inertia was largely gone.\n\nThe researcher of this study, Kenneth Wright, concluded that the best way to sleep better at night and wake up fresher in the morning is to wake up next to natural sunlight.\n\nThe simplest way to do this is to sleep in a room with a window and put your bed next to it to maximize the light you receive in the morning.\n2. Meditate\n\nAs meditation becomes more popular, there are more myths being spread about how to go about it.\n\nThe truth is: meditation is for everyone, and it\u2019s also different for everyone. \n\nThere are many different types of meditation, such as mindful meditation or transcendental mediation, but there\u2019s no one technique to define how you should meditate. Yet the benefits are clear: meditation helps us reduce our anxiety levels, increases our productivity, and even improves our memories.\n\n \n\nmeditation\n\nUsing advanced technology like fMRI scans, scientists have observed a decrease in beta waves in our brains after a 20-minute meditation session.\n\nIn simpler terms, our brain has stopped processing the distracting information that normally surrounds us to give us a peace of mind.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, we recommend trying out Headspace, where they walk you through step-by-step on how to start meditating.\n3. Minimize your decisions\n\nHow does the leader of the free world, Barack Obama, get things done?\n\n He automates his decisions.\n\n    \u201cYou\u2019ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,\u201d [Obama] said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to pare down decisions. I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d\n\nThe reason why we want to minimize our decisions is due to what psychologists call decision fatigue. It\u2019s the act of making exhausting our decisions, which prevents us our ability to make better decisions later on.\n\nObama takes it even further by receiving simple \u201cdecision memos\u201d on his desk with three check boxes:\n\n    agree\n    disagree\n    let\u2019s discuss\n\nRather than expressing his decision through a complicated essay, this simple process speeds up the feedback loop to get things done faster.\n\nbarack obama\n\nNow you may not have as many important decisions to make as the President of the United States, but we can certainly model his morning routines to increase our productivity as well.\n\nAre there small to large decisions that you can automate on a daily basis?\n\nSimple actions could include: picking out your outfit before bedtime, eating the same breakfast each morning, waking up earlier to avoid route changes, etc.\n4. Eat the frog\n\nIn the book Eat the frog, Brian Tracy explains that our \u201cfrog\u201d is the biggest and most important task, which you\u2019re procrastinating on.\n\u201cIf the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worse things that is going to happen to you all day long .\u201d\u2014 Mark Twain\n\nWe should be eating the biggest frog we have the first thing in the morning, no matter how painful it may be.\n\nThe reason why we want to do this first is because much like decision making, we have a limited amount of willpower, and once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\n\nbrain on meditation\n\nWe also have high levels of creativity and willpower in the morning, and studies confirm this as our prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain activating creativity, is the most active immediately after waking up.\n\nThis is crucial for anyone who wants to learn a new language or wanting to learn a skill faster.\n\nPick up your frog and eat it in the morning!\n5. The \u201cOne Thing\u201d\n\nDo you have a to-do list?\n\nIf you do, chances are that 90% of the things on our list are not as important as we may think. Nor should they be.\n\nUpon researching the successful habits of over 200 billionaires, Olympic athletes, and entrepreneurs, Kevin Kruse reported that none of them mentioned a to-do list.\n\nAccording to Kruse, there are a few key weaknesses of a to-do list:\n\n    Doesn\u2019t account for time. When we have a long list of tasks, we tend to tackle those that can be completed quickly in a few minutes, leaving the longer items left undone. Research from the company iDoneThis indicates that 41% of all to-do list items are never completed!\n\n    Doesn\u2019t distinguish between urgent and important. Once again, our impulse is to fight the urgent and ignore the important. (Are you overdue for your next colonoscopy or mammogram?)\n\n    Contribute to stress. In what\u2019s known in psychology as the Zeigarnik effect, unfinished tasks contribute to intrusive, uncontrolled thoughts. It\u2019s no wonder we feel so overwhelmed in the day, but fight insomnia at night.\n\nInstead of picking a list of things to do, we should pick the \u201cone thing.\u201d\n\nThat is, the one thing that will have the most impact towards achieving your goals, so when you complete that one thing, everything else becomes easier or unnecessary.\n\nThis is what Gary Keller, author of The ONE Thing, calls the Domino Effect.\n\ngoal setting\n\nNow take a look at your to-do list.\n\nBy the end of the day, if you completed only one thing on your list, which would you feel satisfied knowing you finished it?\n6. Cherish your evenings\n\nHow you spend your evenings and the last few hours before you sleep is just as important, often more important.\n\nThere\u2019s 2 major reasons for that.\n\n    The quality of your sleep. \n\nHow you feel when you wake up and how you\u2019ll feel for the rest of the day is dependent on how you sleep.\nIf you can\u2019t master your evenings, you can\u2019t master your day.\n\nCountless studies have found that electronic devices harm our sleep cycles. If you\u2019re one of the many having trouble falling sleep on a routine or at all, Dr. Verma advises turning off electronics at least 1\u20132 hours before bedtime (this includes Kindles and other e-readers!)\n\nThe reason for this, explains researcher Mariana Figueiro, is because artificial light suppresses the release of melatonin\u200a\u2014\u200aa hormone in the circadian system which is the body\u2019s clock.\n\n    Preparation, preparation, preparation. \n\nThe last thing we want to do when we wake up in the morning is to use up our willpower trying to decide how we should spend our day.\n\nBefore planning your day however, Greg McKeown, author of Essentialism, recommends reflecting how your day went through a daily journal. He goes on to explain that if we don\u2019t know what we did right or what we did wrong today, how can we maximize our plan for tomorrow?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve reflected on your current day, it\u2019s time to schedule for your next day.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed previously how top-performers rarely use to-do lists.\nHowever, Kruse states that almost all of them lives in their calendar.\n\nScheduling tasks on your calendar cures all the issues found in a to-do list because you can manage for time, schedule your priorities in the beginning of the day (when you have the most willpower), and it prevents excess stress since you can schedule breaks in between.\n7. The Wake Up Shower\n\nThe Wake Up Shower, also known as Misogi, is a ritual that Samurai Warriors used to do by pouring buckets of cold water on their heads each morning.\n\nNot all of us are born to become Samurai Warriors (although who knows), but this routine has now extended into a popular practice called Hot and Cold Hydrotherapy. \n\nIn fact, several studies show that hot and cold hydrotherapy has multiple benefits for our health, including reduced stress, stronger immune system,increased ability to burn fat, and even fighting depression.\n\nLuckily, we can enjoy the luxury of this therapy in our very own showers.\n\nAll it requires is a small tweak.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nTake your regular cleansing shower in normal temperature. Then crank the nozzle to get it as cold as possible. Wait for 30 seconds.\n\nNow crank it to become as hot as you can stand.

Hit the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that we do this because our body releases serotonin into our bloodstream when we sleep, which is a neurotransmitter associated with happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, humans as species are not used to being woken up from artificial noise, as we woke up naturally throughout evolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite how satisfied we may feel hitting the snooze button to sneak in that extra 10 minutes of sleep, it\u2019s actually doing us more harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is because when we return to sleep, our body pumps out dopamine, a chemical that suppresses feelings of sleepiness. As a result, our body is chemically pulled in both directions, leaving us disorientated and groggy.\nMyth #2: Depending on rewards alone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We often use rewards to motivate ourselves to do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about the infamous sit-up routine in exchange of a chocolate cake as the reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although rewards are an important part of the equation, it\u2019s not the entire picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the book Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg claims that you can\u2019t rely on rewards to get that habit to stick. It\u2019s a whole system, which he calls the habit loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;feedback loop&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to rid the habit of waking up late, you need to start by identifying the cue that is causing the habit in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Is it the dreaded thought of choosing which outfit you need to wear?\nPerhaps it\u2019s the effort of making breakfast before you rush off to work.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duhigg suggests that cues fall into five categories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Location, time, emotional state, other people, and immediately preceding action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is to isolate your cravings and reward, so you can replace your bad habit with something good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of hitting the snooze button and falling back to sleep, you could reward yourself with a hot cup of coffee. The cue could be as simple as the smell of coffee, which you can ask your roommate to brew every morning.\nMyth #3: All strategies work for everyone&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no one size fits all with establishing morning habits that fits us best. The average adult needs 7\u20139 hours of sleep, yet some of us only need 6 hours, while others need 10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, some of us have to shower in the morning to wake ourselves up, while some of us only need a cup of coffee to get going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In her book Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives, Gretchen Rubin suggests most of us fall into one of four different general categories with regards to motivation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Upholders respond readily to both outer expectations and inner expectations.\nQuestioners question all expectations, and will meet an expectation only if they believe it\u2019s justified.\nObligers respond readily to outer expectations but struggle to meet inner expectations.\nRebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing which category you fall into can help you best navigate how you should form your new habits moving forward.\nIn fact, it\u2019s also helpful in navigating which advice you should follow, and which to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gretchen has a short quiz you can take to know which of these groups you belong to. It\u2019s pretty fascinating, not going to lie!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let\u2019s get on to what you can do to form powerful morning routines to increase productivity.\n1. Wake up next to natural light&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A study was done on a group of adults suffering from sleep deprivation, where they embarked on a week long camping trip. And the results were shocking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In just a few days living in absence of artificial light and alarm clocks, the participants not only had an easier time falling sleep, but they also had an easier time waking up. The sleep inertia was largely gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The researcher of this study, Kenneth Wright, concluded that the best way to sleep better at night and wake up fresher in the morning is to wake up next to natural sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to do this is to sleep in a room with a window and put your bed next to it to maximize the light you receive in the morning.\n2. Meditate&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As meditation becomes more popular, there are more myths being spread about how to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is: meditation is for everyone, and it\u2019s also different for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of meditation, such as mindful meditation or transcendental mediation, but there\u2019s no one technique to define how you should meditate. Yet the benefits are clear: meditation helps us reduce our anxiety levels, increases our productivity, and even improves our memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;meditation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using advanced technology like fMRI scans, scientists have observed a decrease in beta waves in our brains after a 20-minute meditation session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, our brain has stopped processing the distracting information that normally surrounds us to give us a peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re just starting out, we recommend trying out Headspace, where they walk you through step-by-step on how to start meditating.\n3. Minimize your decisions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does the leader of the free world, Barack Obama, get things done?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He automates his decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u201cYou\u2019ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,\u201d [Obama] said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to pare down decisions. I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\u201d\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why we want to minimize our decisions is due to what psychologists call decision fatigue. It\u2019s the act of making exhausting our decisions, which prevents us our ability to make better decisions later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obama takes it even further by receiving simple \u201cdecision memos\u201d on his desk with three check boxes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;agree\ndisagree\nlet\u2019s discuss\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than expressing his decision through a complicated essay, this simple process speeds up the feedback loop to get things done faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;barack obama&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you may not have as many important decisions to make as the President of the United States, but we can certainly model his morning routines to increase our productivity as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are there small to large decisions that you can automate on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simple actions could include: picking out your outfit before bedtime, eating the same breakfast each morning, waking up earlier to avoid route changes, etc.\n4. Eat the frog&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the book Eat the frog, Brian Tracy explains that our \u201cfrog\u201d is the biggest and most important task, which you\u2019re procrastinating on.\n\u201cIf the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worse things that is going to happen to you all day long .\u201d\u2014 Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should be eating the biggest frog we have the first thing in the morning, no matter how painful it may be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why we want to do this first is because much like decision making, we have a limited amount of willpower, and once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;brain on meditation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also have high levels of creativity and willpower in the morning, and studies confirm this as our prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain activating creativity, is the most active immediately after waking up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is crucial for anyone who wants to learn a new language or wanting to learn a skill faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pick up your frog and eat it in the morning!\n5. The \u201cOne Thing\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have a to-do list?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do, chances are that 90% of the things on our list are not as important as we may think. Nor should they be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon researching the successful habits of over 200 billionaires, Olympic athletes, and entrepreneurs, Kevin Kruse reported that none of them mentioned a to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Kruse, there are a few key weaknesses of a to-do list:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Doesn\u2019t account for time. When we have a long list of tasks, we tend to tackle those that can be completed quickly in a few minutes, leaving the longer items left undone. Research from the company iDoneThis indicates that 41% of all to-do list items are never completed!\n\nDoesn\u2019t distinguish between urgent and important. Once again, our impulse is to fight the urgent and ignore the important. (Are you overdue for your next colonoscopy or mammogram?)\n\nContribute to stress. In what\u2019s known in psychology as the Zeigarnik effect, unfinished tasks contribute to intrusive, uncontrolled thoughts. It\u2019s no wonder we feel so overwhelmed in the day, but fight insomnia at night.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of picking a list of things to do, we should pick the \u201cone thing.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is, the one thing that will have the most impact towards achieving your goals, so when you complete that one thing, everything else becomes easier or unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what Gary Keller, author of The ONE Thing, calls the Domino Effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;goal setting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now take a look at your to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, if you completed only one thing on your list, which would you feel satisfied knowing you finished it?\n6. Cherish your evenings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you spend your evenings and the last few hours before you sleep is just as important, often more important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s 2 major reasons for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The quality of your sleep. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How you feel when you wake up and how you\u2019ll feel for the rest of the day is dependent on how you sleep.\nIf you can\u2019t master your evenings, you can\u2019t master your day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Countless studies have found that electronic devices harm our sleep cycles. If you\u2019re one of the many having trouble falling sleep on a routine or at all, Dr. Verma advises turning off electronics at least 1\u20132 hours before bedtime (this includes Kindles and other e-readers!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for this, explains researcher Mariana Figueiro, is because artificial light suppresses the release of melatonin\u200a\u2014\u200aa hormone in the circadian system which is the body\u2019s clock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Preparation, preparation, preparation. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing we want to do when we wake up in the morning is to use up our willpower trying to decide how we should spend our day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before planning your day however, Greg McKeown, author of Essentialism, recommends reflecting how your day went through a daily journal. He goes on to explain that if we don\u2019t know what we did right or what we did wrong today, how can we maximize our plan for tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you\u2019ve reflected on your current day, it\u2019s time to schedule for your next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve discussed previously how top-performers rarely use to-do lists.\nHowever, Kruse states that almost all of them lives in their calendar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scheduling tasks on your calendar cures all the issues found in a to-do list because you can manage for time, schedule your priorities in the beginning of the day (when you have the most willpower), and it prevents excess stress since you can schedule breaks in between.\n7. The Wake Up Shower&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Wake Up Shower, also known as Misogi, is a ritual that Samurai Warriors used to do by pouring buckets of cold water on their heads each morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all of us are born to become Samurai Warriors (although who knows), but this routine has now extended into a popular practice called Hot and Cold Hydrotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, several studies show that hot and cold hydrotherapy has multiple benefits for our health, including reduced stress, stronger immune system,increased ability to burn fat, and even fighting depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we can enjoy the luxury of this therapy in our very own showers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All it requires is a small tweak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take your regular cleansing shower in normal temperature. Then crank the nozzle to get it as cold as possible. Wait for 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now crank it to become as hot as you can stand. This will open up the capillaries and increase blood circulation in your body. Wait another 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, crank the nozzle back to cold, and wait for 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple, but can be shockingly difficult to endure in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can let us know how it went in the comments tomorrow morning!\nMorning routines of the successful&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A powerful way to optimize your morning habit is to simply follow what\u2019s working for the succesful people you admire.\n\u201cGood artists copy, great artists steal.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aPablo Picasso\n1. Tony Robbins&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you thought putting on a 60-minute presentation was difficult, meet Tony Robbins. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony makes a living from putting on 50 to 70 hour presentations over the span of a weekend, and he\u2019s been doing this for the past 3 decades.\n\u201cTony\u2019s power is superhuman\u2026 He\u2019s a catalyst for change.

Priming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing Tony does when he wakes up is priming (instead of meditation, because Tony likes to think, the faster the better because that\u2019s how his brain works).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u201cWherever I am, I do not missing Priming.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aTony Robbins\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b.

Gratitude&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing Tony does is to be grateful for 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. First simple things like the wind on my face, then the things you have in your life, your relationships, your loved ones, your health, \u2026\n\n2. Passions in life\n\n3. Service to others\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Tony\u2019s routine, you can read more here.\n2. Paul J.

Mitchell\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During those five minutes, he tries to be truly \u2018present,\u2019 and is grateful for what he has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, he examines his schedule for the day on his calendar, checks in with his assistants, and takes care of anything urgent such as a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing he doesn\u2019t do: Email. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paul says that it allows him to focus on the most important things that need his attention most in the early part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read more about Paul\u2019s routine here.\n3. Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of Popeyes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like many of us, Cheryl is a fellow night owl, so she designs her morning routines to get her \u2018in the right frame of mind for the day.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She starts her day with music, something she has always done since childhood, which gives her purpose and reminds her of her family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bachelder then spends time reading in the morning, as well as writing on her blog, when she can find the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\u201cTo have the energy to lead, we need to be restored and prepared before we get to the workplace.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aCheryl Bachelder\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin outlined his morning routine by the hour, which you can see below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much like the other successful people we\u2019ve profiled, Franklin was an avid morning person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From 5 to 7AM each morning, Franklin asked himself, \u201cWhat good shall I do today?\u201d which also included addressing the \u201cPowerful Goodness\u201d and setting a plan for the rest of his day.\nbenjamin frankling morning routine\nOver to you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which of the morning routines we\u2019ve outlined will you try out?\nWhat were your key takeaways from the morning routines of the successful?\nWe\u2019d love to hear it in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;p.s\u200a\u2014\u200aif you enjoyed this complete guide, you\u2019ll also enjoy these fellow long-form guides:\n&lt;a href=\"http://rypeapp.com/blog/learning-curve/\"&gt;http://rypeapp.com/blog/learning-curve/&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://rypeapp.com/blog/how-to-achieve-any-goals-in-life-faster/\"&gt;http://rypeapp.com/blog/how-to-achieve-any-goals-in-life-faster/&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://rypeapp.com/blog/how-to-learn-any-language-in-less-than-90-days/\"&gt;http://rypeapp.com/blog/how-to-learn-any-language-in-less-than-90-days/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
