For that I used a series of cheapo bikes that I purchased off Craigslist.\n\nI recently moved out to Colorado and had the opportunity to borrow and ride on a much nicer gravel bike and absolutely loved it. I'm looking to get more into cycling (road and some minor offroad). I'm also starting to date someone who frequently does 30-50 mile rides, I'd like to have a bike that makes it easier to keep up with them. Right now I can borrow a bike and do it but I'd love to be less reliant on that and be able to train on my own.\n\nSo long story short I want to invest in a mid/high range gravel bike. I know I want a gravel bike, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding something that feels right to me. Availability is extremely low, and I don't want to wait months and months to get a bike. My budget is potentially as high as $4500, but so far most options I'm happy with are $2500-$3500 and saving money is always nice.\n\nThere are a few bikes that I'm currently interested in, and I'm curious if some more experienced cyclists can give me some insight into how they would evaluate them. I know there's a lot at play here but I've got a lot of decision fatigue and fretting going on and could benefit from some experienced eyes and advice:\n\n1) [Look 765 Gravel RS - Disk Breaks and Shimano 105 Components](https://planetcyclery.com/bikes/complete-bikes/gravel-cyclocross/look-765-gravel-rs-disc-black-red-shimano-105-2x-comp-bike-2019): The cheapest option - this is in a nearby bike shop. It's available in my size, new, and I've been told that Shimano 105 is a great meeting point for value and performance. At first I didn't love the paint job, but its grown on me a bit.\n\n2) [Scott Addict Gravel 20](https://www.theproscloset.com/products/2017-scott-addict-gravel-20-l): The bike shop landscape around me is otherwise pretty bleak, so I've also been looking at the Pro Closet. In general there doesn't seem to be much of a markdown on the bikes being used, but if the quality is high that's okay with me. This is an older bike that has some cosmetic damage, but overall has some very high quality components and an extremely light frame. Of the bikes I've looked at on the Pro Closet, this is the one that seems like it has the most \"value\". I also prefer the look to the previous bike, although I am trying to not be too shallow.\n\n3) [Cannondale Topstone Carbon RX2](https://www.theproscloset.com/products/2020-cannondale-topstone-carbon-rx-2-m): I lied. I'm very shallow. I like the look and color of this bike so much I want to love it even though I don't think that it has a very strong case versus the other two bikes. This bike is priced very similarly to a new Cannondale bike of the same model (although they are completely out of stock everywhere so it's not like that's an option). IT has some higher quality components than the Look bike, but is used and more expensive. My suspicion is that despite being newer, it is generally inferior to the Scott bike despite having a very similar price point.",
