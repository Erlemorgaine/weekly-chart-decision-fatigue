Women are BUSY. We're out there, under pressure, holding the responsibility for so many things, doing so many jobs, ALL THE JOBS. The third shifts, the fourth shifts, the fourth and fifth trimesters. We're working, we're cooking, cleaning, studying, taking care of kids, taking care of partners, taking care of pets, being caretakers for older family members. We're bringing our kids to dance class, picking them up from Science Olympiad after school, going to their doctor's appointments and parent-teacher meetings. We're making the weekend plans, choosing the restaurant, buying our father-in-law a birthday present. We're doing the food shopping, the laundry, the random errands. We're picking what show to watch next on Netflix. We're dealing with decision fatigue and oppression, on a global scale.\n\nBut we still sometimes don't show up. So what is everyone's voting plan? How is everyone making it a PRIORITY in their schedule? \n\nAre you putting it in Google/Apple calendar? Setting email reminders for yourself?  \nDo you send out a mass text a few days before the election and enthusiastically remind your loved ones to also vote?  \nAre you encouraging young people to register and engage?  \nDo you know how to get your absentee/mail-in/etc ballot, and when you need to send it in by in your particular state?   \nDo you save those little voting cards they send in the mail that have your polling address?   \nDo you have a picture in your mind, a to-do list in your head, about how to organize your time on voting day?   \nDo you know what time your polling place opens and closes, and any information/ID you might need to bring with you on the day of?   \nWhat time will you go? Early, before work? During your lunch break? After classes are over? After the gym? After dinner and before putting the kids to bed?   \nWill you bring your kids with you so they can learn about the process?  \nWill you post about it on social media so that more people are reminded, \"Oh crap, today's election day?!\"\n\nI'd love to hear the little details, logistics, thought processes!
