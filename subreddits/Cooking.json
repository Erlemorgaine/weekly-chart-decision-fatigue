I have a 2 pound bag of carrots I\u2019d love to use up! Either something with carrots in it or something with carrots as a side are both great. \n\nAlready making a soup as one of my meals so no soup suggestions please! Thank you so much!\n\nETA: thank you all for the suggestions!! Off to the grocery store I go :)",

I have a 2 pound bag of carrots I\u2019d love to use up! Either something with carrots in it or something with carrots as a side are both great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Already making a soup as one of my meals so no soup suggestions please!

I can easily do something else for the veg but would like ideas on how to change the chicken Recipe to stovetop or grill.\n\nThe recipe Is for \u201cspicy maple chicken\u201d and says to coat the chicken in sour cream and breadcrumbs, then roast on a sheet pan for about 25 min at 425.  How would you create something similar with the breadcrumbs still incorporated but make it stovetop or on the grill instead? Also note I\u2019d rather not deep fry. \n\nFinally the kit comes with sweet potatoes to be boiled and mashed which really isn\u2019t something that sounds appetizing to me in summer...what else can I do with sweet potatoes that might be lighter/more refreshing in the heat?\n\nThanks in advance everyone!",
