Before Commander Masters was released, one of my favorite decks I had built was \\[\\[Mazzy\\]\\] which was focused on saccing and recurring auras. I loved it because I love finding a use for old cards, or just bad cards, that are basically unplayable now. Cards like \\[\\[briar shield\\]\\], \\[\\[carapace\\]\\], or \\[\\[faith healer\\]\\] would probably be worthless in any other deck (or at least, most other decks) but are great for this one. One of the best cards in the deck was \\[\\[unbridled growth\\]\\]. Keep in mind, this is before Commander Masters, and I was trying to keep the deck under $100, and there were still around 200+ cards I wanted to include in the deck. Getting down to 100 cards was incredibly hard.\n\nThen Commander Masters comes out, and introduces new cards that I now *need* for the deck like \\[\\[Nyxborn Behemoth\\]\\], and makes a bunch of other cards that were previously out of my budget now includable due to reprints.\n\nIt also introduced \\[\\[Narci\\]\\], and I wanted to make a similar build for her but not using any sagas, which I\u2019m calling \u201cNarci\u2019s Novellas\u201d - since I feel like a novella is the opposite of a saga. Again, the deck has 200+ cards that I\u2019d like to include if I could.\n\nThen comes Wilds, which introduces the bargain mechanic, which slots into the archetype nicely, and another crapton of cards that I want to include, like \\[\\[Archon of the Wild Rose\\]\\], \\[\\[Slumbering Keepguard\\]\\], and \\[\\[Timber Paladin\\]\\], and even more reprints of cards I would\u2019ve included before but couldn\u2019t afford to. I'm also now building \\[\\[Eriette\\]\\] and \\[\\[Yenna\\]\\], and I was honestly hoping that dropping down to 2-colors would make my decisions easier, but it didn\u2019t really help much.\n\nI\u2019m now considering asking my playgroup to allow me to up the deck size, which I think they\u2019ll be fine with, but I kind of hate how I feel when I bend the rules, even though it\u2019ll just make my decks worse (if anyone actually wants to try a milling-out strategy, or something else where my deck size would actually benefit me, I would just play a different deck).\n\nAnyone else feeling similarly?\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: to people offering suggestions, I was just venting!
