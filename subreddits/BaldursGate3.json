I\u2019ve done everything I can think of - vanilla lawful good, resist Durge, chaotic neutral-turned-chaotic good, etc etc, but I NEVER thought I would have the balls to do a full evil Durge run. Well, I started one this weekend and I\u2019m\u2026 kind of loving it?\n\nFull disclosure that I\u2019m still in Act 1, so maybe the later acts will have the \u201cempty\u201d problem I keep hearing about. But man, it\u2019s just so different from my previous playthroughs that it\u2019s refreshing. I appreciate my tight Astarion, Shadowheart, and Lae\u2019zel team (and Gale being resentful in camp), as it removes some of the decision fatigue. And yeah, it\u2019s fun to have the three of them CONSTANTLY hyping you up lol. I think the following decisions made it more fun/easier to stomach:\n\n1 and most important: stealing the Druid Idol. This was also just fun because I had NO idea what would happen - in my head, I was role playing that my Durge liked those naughty thieving kids in the hideout, and hated the pretentious druids. But it also removed the very-hard-to-stomach thing of killing the Tieflings - I didn\u2019t kill a single Tiefling directly. I stole the idol, killed the druids doing the ritual, and then the Druids did the rest of the work. Seriously, by the time I came back to the Grove with the goblins, there was no one there.\n\n2. Actually role playing instead of just doing the most over-the-top evil thing in every situation. My Durge didn\u2019t rip Gale\u2019s arm off and is instead keeping him around for his utility. He definitely hates her, but I honestly think that\u2019s both more evil and interesting. It allows me to see more of his character and deepens the story I\u2019m role playing. She\u2019s also not terribly cruel to Shart, Astarion, and Lae\u2019zel - she knows she needs allies and honestly, maybe somewhere in that blackened heart of hers, she has a soft spot for them.\n\n3. Not skipping the content that\u2019s still there. I killed Auntie Ethel only because she threatened my Durge - plus, it led to the most evil twist of reviving Mayrina\u2019s husband only to keep the wand myself. I don\u2019t plan on skipping the Underdark, even though I can. There\u2019s plenty you can do there that\u2019s either neutral (the Adamantine Forge, the Masterwork weapon, fighting the Beholder) and evil (siding with Glut and Nere).\n\n4.

I\u2019ve done everything I can think of - vanilla lawful good, resist Durge, chaotic neutral-turned-chaotic good, etc etc, but I NEVER thought I would have the balls to do a full evil Durge run. Well, I started one this weekend and I\u2019m\u2026 kind of loving it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure that I\u2019m still in Act 1, so maybe the later acts will have the \u201cempty\u201d problem I keep hearing about. But man, it\u2019s just so different from my previous playthroughs that it\u2019s refreshing. I appreciate my tight Astarion, Shadowheart, and Lae\u2019zel team (and Gale being resentful in camp), as it removes some of the decision fatigue. And yeah, it\u2019s fun to have the three of them CONSTANTLY hyping you up lol. I think the following decisions made it more fun/easier to stomach:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 and most important: stealing the Druid Idol. This was also just fun because I had NO idea what would happen - in my head, I was role playing that my Durge liked those naughty thieving kids in the hideout, and hated the pretentious druids. But it also removed the very-hard-to-stomach thing of killing the Tieflings - I didn\u2019t kill a single Tiefling directly. I stole the idol, killed the druids doing the ritual, and then the Druids did the rest of the work. Seriously, by the time I came back to the Grove with the goblins, there was no one there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually role playing instead of just doing the most over-the-top evil thing in every situation. My Durge didn\u2019t rip Gale\u2019s arm off and is instead keeping him around for his utility. He definitely hates her, but I honestly think that\u2019s both more evil and interesting. It allows me to see more of his character and deepens the story I\u2019m role playing. She\u2019s also not terribly cruel to Shart, Astarion, and Lae\u2019zel - she knows she needs allies and honestly, maybe somewhere in that blackened heart of hers, she has a soft spot for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not skipping the content that\u2019s still there. I killed Auntie Ethel only because she threatened my Durge - plus, it led to the most evil twist of reviving Mayrina\u2019s husband only to keep the wand myself. I don\u2019t plan on skipping the Underdark, even though I can. There\u2019s plenty you can do there that\u2019s either neutral (the Adamantine Forge, the Masterwork weapon, fighting the Beholder) and evil (siding with Glut and Nere).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t get the cutscene of beheading Karlach - just a quick fight and it was over.
