I was an outcasted teen and MFA gave me confidence when it felt like no one else could. \n\nNow as a 22 year old who\u2019s spent far too much time learning about dressing better and trying to present myself as the best me I can; I don\u2019t spend as much time on this sub anymore. I\u2019ve found the styles I love and what looks most appealing on my frame. I know how to look for a GYW boot and measure myself for a new pair of raws. This sub is no longer as helpful for me.

Which is the kind of shit I love to see. \n\nIf you look in the comments however you\u2019ll see people being mean for no reason.

For the most part people are giving good advice and complementing OP. Some of you however are just sour. \n\nThis is all I have to say. I\u2019m in mobile otherwise I\u2019d pull more examples.

My goal was to force a re-examination of my relationship with this hobby, and hopefully accelerate a path to the holy state of [contentedness](https://dieworkwear.com/2020/08/01/on-emotional-durability/). A secondary goal was to build a stronger resistance to the urge to consume. For some background, I left my job in November with nothing lined up so that made committing to this limit **easier** compared to if I did it while having disposable income. All of my words are a personal reflection as I\u2019ve had my stake in clothes for a good 10 years now and went through the lifecycle of being [unaware](https://i.imgur.com/pYXIcOT.jpg), [aware](https://i.imgur.com/1ldvBa6.jpg), [interested](https://i.imgur.com/Df8WL2p.jpg), [obsessed](https://i.imgur.com/0fEF3nf.jpg), and [mature](https://i.imgur.com/hG6lrl7.jpg) (source: [frugal aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2P8crHIVtI)). I don\u2019t think this is a guide per se, because some of my lessons are stating the obvious; though I hope some ideas can be helpful wherever the reader finds themselves in their fashion journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 1: our media habits can insidiously throw us into a perpetual cycle of \u201clack\u201d**\u00a0\n\nThe first thing I did was I slowly weaned myself off of fashion-centric platforms/websites. The impact on my contentment was two-fold: 1) I saw less of what people were wearing online and 2) I saw less of what people were buying. Because I eliminated the main sources of this intrigue-lack-want-purchase loop, I became alot more content with time. Here are the sites/platforms I took a break from:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Secondhand resale platforms**: Grailed, eBay, Yahoo Japan Auctions, Mercari, TRR\n* **Online fashion communities:** Discord, Reddit, Styleforum\n* **Social media platforms:** Instagram\n\nThat is not to say that I completely threw appreciating clothes to the wayside. I\u2019m fortunate to still live in LA and give myself opportunities to window shop and talk to the SAs at my favorite store/flea markets. It feels so much better to nerd about the new stock and observe what other people are wearing IRL. These continue to be reliable sources of inspiration for me. Another thing I took up to doing is that if I spent any time on the online fashion communities, it was for the sole purpose of giving constructive feedback to other users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 2: you will come to understand what comprises your core wardrobe**\n\nFashion marketers were onto something when they were shoving the \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d down our throats years ago. I personally find it hard to define my capsule wardrobe because I value eclecticism, so I\u2019ll revise that phrase by saying that **every person\u2019s wardrobe has its layers**. Here are some questions I asked myself when I started taking stock of what I owned:\n\n* **Core: easiest to style, recognizable, and most comfortable to wear pieces**\n   * Looking at my wardrobe, what are the easiest pieces to style?\n   * What are my signature pieces that I feel most comfortable in?\n* **Middle: takes some effort to style, but generally aligned to the wardrobe**\n   * What pieces can only be paired with certain aesthetics/color palettes? Alternatively, am I only wearing this piece in a certain combination?\n* **Surface: tough-to-style, statement, or incongruous pieces to everything else**\n   * What pieces can be hard to style with others without sacrificing cohesion?\n\nI\u2019d probably define my style as the relaxed americana bastard that took[ joseph\u2019s amazing technicolor dreamcoat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp4Fym1KImY) literally. My core wardrobe consists of Nepenthes family brands (AiE, Engineered Garments, and Needles), Workwear/Americana adjacent brands (Bode, Man-tle, S.K. Manor Hill, Story MFG), and Japanese brands (Kapital, Unused, Uru).\n\nAnything new that I planned on purchasing **has** to fit within this vocabulary because I want to wear it with as many combinations as possible without sacrificing cohesion. Two things happened as a result: I wore alot more of everything I owned and I also started selling my \u201csurface\u201d pieces. I personally don\u2019t believe in keeping an archive of \u201cgrails\u201d that I no longer wear, I\u2019m happy to pass that along at a reasonable price to someone else who wants to enjoy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 3: it\u2019s nice to have nice things, but don\u2019t let that get in the way of finding your own definition of prosperity**\n\nI think the general public sees fashion as frivolous because over-consumption of clothes can make it seem like a blood sport. I\u2019m guilty of this because 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 felt like years of over-consumption of clothes. In defense of the early years, the online fashion space felt very different because there was no Tik Tok and it still seemed like people wanted to experiment for the sake of learning more about themselves through clothes. Today, my curiosity continues to be piqued by new designers (though keeping up through consumption and sharing fit pics feels less of a priority).\n\nOnce I reflected on the journey, I undertook an exercise of redefining daily \u201cprosperity\u201d and those days had nothing to do with buying clothes. My best days being unemployed were ones where I rode my motorcycle, saw a friend for a coffee, went to dance classes, or had a tiring workout before I cooked myself a nice dinner. Though I\u2019m more introverted now than I was when I was employed, the slow pace of living has allowed me to recharge from years of accumulated burnout in the tech industry, and I had less decision fatigue from thinking about what I needed to kop from my SSENSE wishlist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 4: being a passive follower doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy it**\n\nAs previously mentioned, what you take from your journey stays with you and the hobby intrinsically becomes a [part of you](https://alittlebitofrest.com/2022/11/28/menswear-is-my-hobby/#more-44855). You can continue to participate and as an older fart in this community, we need more personable people who can inspire others to find joy in this medium of expression. I think get-ready-with-me content is very played out (happy for them though) and is partly to blame for the lack we feel when we look at our wardrobes. There\u2019s too much showpersonship and the over-saturation of micro-trends (in my opinion) has created a less-discerning average fashion enthusiast. As an eternal optimist, I envision a world of more enthusiasts who are content with what they have and are intentional about sourcing their clothes in a sustainable way. I sincerely hope that we see a counter-trend of contentedness surfaces as time goes on.\n\nThrough alot of personal reflection, I surprised myself by going down a content hole and finding some great channels/sites that share great analysis on the macro-trends and community as a whole. This kind of self-awareness is great and they\u2019re worth checking out:\n\n* [Antwon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsCHzuw4XTo)\n* [Fashion Elitist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9EJcp4ppeqKET1f_Z0S8Tw)\n* [Fashionlover4](https://www.youtube.com/@fashionlover4)\n* [Frugal Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@FrugalAesthetic/videos)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Takeaways and goodbye**\n\nTaking this all into consideration, I became a more mindful consumer and ended up being alot more content with what I had by reducing my fashion media consumption, identifying the core pieces of my wardrobe, redefining prosperity (without having to consume), and finding alternative ways to participate in the discourse that bring positivity to others. At the time of this publishing, I broke the seal and made my first purchase of the year, but I\u2019m excited to continue this four-item limit until the end of the year and hope to expand on what I learned then.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my words! Please remember that these are my own thoughts on the matter and disagreements are totally cool. I\u2019d love to hear other people\u2019s reflections if they\u2019re doing something similar and look forward to our discussions. PEACE AND BE GOOD TO ONE ANOTHER.",

My goal was to force a re-examination of my relationship with this hobby, and hopefully accelerate a path to the holy state of &lt;a href=\"https://dieworkwear.com/2020/08/01/on-emotional-durability/\"&gt;contentedness&lt;/a&gt;. A secondary goal was to build a stronger resistance to the urge to consume. For some background, I left my job in November with nothing lined up so that made committing to this limit &lt;strong&gt;easier&lt;/strong&gt; compared to if I did it while having disposable income. All of my words are a personal reflection as I\u2019ve had my stake in clothes for a good 10 years now and went through the lifecycle of being &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pYXIcOT.jpg\"&gt;unaware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1ldvBa6.jpg\"&gt;aware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Df8WL2p.jpg\"&gt;interested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0fEF3nf.jpg\"&gt;obsessed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hG6lrl7.jpg\"&gt;mature&lt;/a&gt; (source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2P8crHIVtI\"&gt;frugal aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;). I don\u2019t think this is a guide per se, because some of my lessons are stating the obvious; though I hope some ideas can be helpful wherever the reader finds themselves in their fashion journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1: our media habits can insidiously throw us into a perpetual cycle of \u201clack\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was I slowly weaned myself off of fashion-centric platforms/websites. The impact on my contentment was two-fold: 1) I saw less of what people were wearing online and 2) I saw less of what people were buying. Because I eliminated the main sources of this intrigue-lack-want-purchase loop, I became alot more content with time. Here are the sites/platforms I took a break from:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondhand resale platforms&lt;/strong&gt;: Grailed, eBay, Yahoo Japan Auctions, Mercari, TRR&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online fashion communities:&lt;/strong&gt; Discord, Reddit, Styleforum&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Instagram&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that I completely threw appreciating clothes to the wayside. I\u2019m fortunate to still live in LA and give myself opportunities to window shop and talk to the SAs at my favorite store/flea markets. It feels so much better to nerd about the new stock and observe what other people are wearing IRL. These continue to be reliable sources of inspiration for me. Another thing I took up to doing is that if I spent any time on the online fashion communities, it was for the sole purpose of giving constructive feedback to other users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2: you will come to understand what comprises your core wardrobe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fashion marketers were onto something when they were shoving the \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d down our throats years ago. I personally find it hard to define my capsule wardrobe because I value eclecticism, so I\u2019ll revise that phrase by saying that &lt;strong&gt;every person\u2019s wardrobe has its layers&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are some questions I asked myself when I started taking stock of what I owned:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core: easiest to style, recognizable, and most comfortable to wear pieces&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Looking at my wardrobe, what are the easiest pieces to style?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are my signature pieces that I feel most comfortable in?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle: takes some effort to style, but generally aligned to the wardrobe&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What pieces can only be paired with certain aesthetics/color palettes? Alternatively, am I only wearing this piece in a certain combination?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface: tough-to-style, statement, or incongruous pieces to everything else&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What pieces can be hard to style with others without sacrificing cohesion?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d probably define my style as the relaxed americana bastard that took&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp4Fym1KImY\"&gt; joseph\u2019s amazing technicolor dreamcoat&lt;/a&gt; literally. My core wardrobe consists of Nepenthes family brands (AiE, Engineered Garments, and Needles), Workwear/Americana adjacent brands (Bode, Man-tle, S.K. Manor Hill, Story MFG), and Japanese brands (Kapital, Unused, Uru).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything new that I planned on purchasing &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to fit within this vocabulary because I want to wear it with as many combinations as possible without sacrificing cohesion. Two things happened as a result: I wore alot more of everything I owned and I also started selling my \u201csurface\u201d pieces. I personally don\u2019t believe in keeping an archive of \u201cgrails\u201d that I no longer wear, I\u2019m happy to pass that along at a reasonable price to someone else who wants to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3: it\u2019s nice to have nice things, but don\u2019t let that get in the way of finding your own definition of prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the general public sees fashion as frivolous because over-consumption of clothes can make it seem like a blood sport. I\u2019m guilty of this because 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 felt like years of over-consumption of clothes. In defense of the early years, the online fashion space felt very different because there was no Tik Tok and it still seemed like people wanted to experiment for the sake of learning more about themselves through clothes. Today, my curiosity continues to be piqued by new designers (though keeping up through consumption and sharing fit pics feels less of a priority).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I reflected on the journey, I undertook an exercise of redefining daily \u201cprosperity\u201d and those days had nothing to do with buying clothes. My best days being unemployed were ones where I rode my motorcycle, saw a friend for a coffee, went to dance classes, or had a tiring workout before I cooked myself a nice dinner. Though I\u2019m more introverted now than I was when I was employed, the slow pace of living has allowed me to recharge from years of accumulated burnout in the tech industry, and I had less decision fatigue from thinking about what I needed to kop from my SSENSE wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 4: being a passive follower doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, what you take from your journey stays with you and the hobby intrinsically becomes a &lt;a href=\"https://alittlebitofrest.com/2022/11/28/menswear-is-my-hobby/#more-44855\"&gt;part of you&lt;/a&gt;. You can continue to participate and as an older fart in this community, we need more personable people who can inspire others to find joy in this medium of expression. I think get-ready-with-me content is very played out (happy for them though) and is partly to blame for the lack we feel when we look at our wardrobes. There\u2019s too much showpersonship and the over-saturation of micro-trends (in my opinion) has created a less-discerning average fashion enthusiast. As an eternal optimist, I envision a world of more enthusiasts who are content with what they have and are intentional about sourcing their clothes in a sustainable way. I sincerely hope that we see a counter-trend of contentedness surfaces as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through alot of personal reflection, I surprised myself by going down a content hole and finding some great channels/sites that share great analysis on the macro-trends and community as a whole. This kind of self-awareness is great and they\u2019re worth checking out:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsCHzuw4XTo\"&gt;Antwon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9EJcp4ppeqKET1f_Z0S8Tw\"&gt;Fashion Elitist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@fashionlover4\"&gt;Fashionlover4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FrugalAesthetic/videos\"&gt;Frugal Aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways and goodbye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking this all into consideration, I became a more mindful consumer and ended up being alot more content with what I had by reducing my fashion media consumption, identifying the core pieces of my wardrobe, redefining prosperity (without having to consume), and finding alternative ways to participate in the discourse that bring positivity to others. At the time of this publishing, I broke the seal and made my first purchase of the year, but I\u2019m excited to continue this four-item limit until the end of the year and hope to expand on what I learned then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read my words! Please remember that these are my own thoughts on the matter and disagreements are totally cool. I\u2019d love to hear other people\u2019s reflections if they\u2019re doing something similar and look forward to our discussions. PEACE AND BE GOOD TO ONE ANOTHER.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
