Therefore if you want to achieve things, you must:\n\n\\-Strive to start early in the day\n\n\\-Automate as much as possible in your life\n\nThis is allegedly the reason Steve jobs wore the same thing every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, for me I find that it doesn't quite work that way. As a matter of fact, I'm kind of the opposite. When I am well rested, decisions are easy, but the easier the decision, the easier the distraction.\n\nIts easy to put off study in lieu of completing a pokedex\\*\\* entry or cleaning my bathroom.\n\nHowever, when I am tired, towards the end of the day, it does become harder to make decisions, so I tend to stay with the ones I pick. Choosing to finish a SQL chapter is simply easier than staring 5-10 new tasks.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to share this with you all. Perhaps some of you can find a way to leverage this insight? **At minimum, I think you should try to remember that screwing off in the beginning of a day doesn't condemn you to have an unproductive end of the day.**\n\n\\*\\* Perhaps I'll write about this later, but FYI the Pokemon games Jive well with ADHD. The games are all clearly divided into neat tasks that you can pick up and putdown at will. Therefore its easier to avoid getting stuck in a video game hole. Also min of playtime works well as a positive reinforcement reward (I'll play 20 min once I finish the chapter.)",

Therefore if you want to achieve things, you must:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Strive to start early in the day&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Automate as much as possible in your life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is allegedly the reason Steve jobs wore the same thing every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for me I find that it doesn&amp;#39;t quite work that way. As a matter of fact, I&amp;#39;m kind of the opposite. When I am well rested, decisions are easy, but the easier the decision, the easier the distraction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its easy to put off study in lieu of completing a pokedex** entry or cleaning my bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when I am tired, towards the end of the day, it does become harder to make decisions, so I tend to stay with the ones I pick. Choosing to finish a SQL chapter is simply easier than staring 5-10 new tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to share this with you all. Perhaps some of you can find a way to leverage this insight? &lt;strong&gt;At minimum, I think you should try to remember that screwing off in the beginning of a day doesn&amp;#39;t condemn you to have an unproductive end of the day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** Perhaps I&amp;#39;ll write about this later, but FYI the Pokemon games Jive well with ADHD. The games are all clearly divided into neat tasks that you can pick up and putdown at will. Therefore its easier to avoid getting stuck in a video game hole. Also min of playtime works well as a positive reinforcement reward (I&amp;#39;ll play 20 min once I finish the chapter.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "TL;DR **Make less choices and spend less energy making those choices.** \n\nI was watching a [very good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0) that was recently posted here by /u/roland00 and some information kind of snapped into place for me several days after.\n\nIn the video, part of the takeaway for me was that the problems we see with ADHD is a loss of executive function as a function of the will power \"fuel tank\" (blood glucose in the brain). This reminded me immediately of [Ego Depletion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion), which essentially boils down to the idea that we all have a fuel tank and that the strength of our decision-making abilities/ the quality of the choices we make is directly related to how much willpower we have left. When we have made too many consecutive choices or acts of willpower without refilling the tank, we end up in a state of [Decision Fatigue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). \n\nThis idea was already related in my mind to [Choice Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture) and [Minimalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living) as means of slowing/ combating decision fatigue. I promise I'm getting to my point, just bare with me a little while longer. One of the best examples of minimalism as it relates to decision fatigue that I read was about people that only own two colors of suit so that when they wake up in the morning, they have an easy choice to make and they retain more of their choosing power for bigger and more important decisions. \n\nHow does this relate to ADHD? \n\nI propose that people with ADHD are especially sensitive to decision fatigue, having limited willpower \"fuel tanks\", and thus needing the greater scaffolding (as mentioned in the video linked earlier in this post). My conclusion is that we have a need for a radical form of minimalism where we not only reduce but eliminate all non-essential choices in order to maximize our potential for making quality choices (which will relate to greater ease focusing and being attentive). \n\nMy proposed solution for the ADHD lifestyle, with or without medication (I'm not advocating either, that's a personal choice), is that we eliminate choices (even in some moderately inconvenient places) and that we farm out executive function. Some of the ways I've developed to do that in my own life involves things like wardrobe and meal minimalism. I wear a suit every day for work and I own three suits. In the morning, I walk to my closet and I pull out the suit to the far left (and at night I hang that suit back up on the far right), I grab the leftmost white shirt and the leftmost tie. To me, this is superior even to a two-choice paradigm in that there is no choice involved. You take what's there and you wear it. Similarly, I will often cook one meal for the entire week (and purchase things for one meal that doesn't have to be cooked) and eat the same things repeatedly (this works well for my strength training as well). I also farm out my executive functioning by scheduling alarms. I have an alarm to wake up, an alarm to take my vitamins, an alarm to get dressed, an alarm to leave the house and an alarm telling me I'm late (if I haven't left the house by that time) and I'm expanding my alarm system to begin scheduling tasks that work better when you do them in small chunks daily (writing, cleaning, meditation, making phone contact with people, etc). I spend very little time per week structuring my alarms so that it concentrates my time spent in executive functioning mode and as a result, I use a lot less of my mental energy over the course of the week to get things done. \n\nI'll round this out by saying that I was going to go into the other side of the spectrum (preventing blood sugar spikes and drops through a simple carb and protein diet to regulate the fuel tank and doing endurance exercise to increase fuel tank size) but I'm on the downward side of my nicotine rush and I'm suddenly overcome by laziness and apathy. \n\nThoughts?",

Which is stupid because I end up doing nothing but I literally can't help it.   \nThen I saw this creator on tiktok work through their to do list using a \"wheel of choice\". I don't know if it is the correct name, English is not my first langage, but it's one of those rainbow wheels with many options. You can find some free \"virtual\" ones online.   \nInput your tasks / activities in it and make the wheel spin. And then you do the task the wheel selects randomly.   \nI don't feel guilty or overwhelmed about all my other tasks because the wheel has chosen. If I have let's say 3 urgent tasks and then 10 not urgent ones, I will first add only those 3 on the wheel, go through them, and then add the other ones.   \n\n\nObviously it's not the most time efficient. It would be better, in terms of house chores for example, to go through all of the kitchen tasks first. Or all the tasks on the computer. But it helps me so much that I don't care if it's not perfectly efficient.   \nI feel especially overwhelmed in the morning and sometimes I will literally add \"brush my teeth\", \"eat breakfast\", etc. It helps tremendously as I get extremely bad decision fatigue and overwhelm. \n\n  \nTo do lists have never worked for me. I'm reluctant to attend hard tasks, but then I feel too guilty to relax. If I go through my wheel of choice, then I know that now is the time to write the stressful message I have been putting off sending. And on the next spin, maybe the wheel will select 45 minutes of reading and I will actually DO IT.   \nActually, writing this post was part of the wheel tasks' lol. I would have never gotten to it without the help of the wheel. I hope this tip helps someone!! ",

I\u2019ve achieved consistency for the first time in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sharing this story/question because I want to hear what you would create that would change the ADHD game for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nI've been uncluttering a lot recently and it found it helps my chaotic life a lot, so I'm sharing what advice I found best. This isn't a comprehensive guide top-to-bottom everything-you-need-to-know. (There are some links at the bottom for that.) This is some stuff useful for anyone, but mainly focused on our challenges. Add some if you have more! :)\n\n### What's harder when you have ADHD\n\n1. Weaker focus.\n2. Weaker memory. (\"Where did I put these keys again?\")\n3. Weaker decision making.\n4. [Decison fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) is a thing: it means not only decisions make you tired, but the more you make, the weaker the next ones are. That's why the jobs with many decisions are hard, stresfull and paid like a boss. The less you have to make, the better.\n5. I think we are more prone to decision fatigue. \"Should I start horseback riding? Should I think about this now or try to re-focus on work?\" Also, trying to take a decision, postponing it and doing it later counts as 2 decisions. (Or 3. Or more.) However, it's more shots, but you only get one point.\n6. Perfectionism.\n\n### How can uncluttering help?\n\n1. **The clutter is talking** to me. \"I'm a wrapper, toss me!\" \"I'm a reciept, file me!\" \"Get me home!\" \"Don't forget me tomorrow!\". As if I needed more distractions.\n2. \"One place for everything\" means **less searching and remembering**. I know where my keys are! :)\n3. \"One place for everything\" means **less decisions**. \"Where should I put this pasta?\" On the shelf with rice and pasta! :)\n4. Seeing what you have at a glance means having **less to remember**. \"What should I wear today? With this top go with that skirt in the drawer or that one on the floor? I have nothing to wear!\" Perfectly matching skirt was forgotten in the wardrobe.\n5. Seeing what you have at a glance means having **less shopping**. \"I think I'm running out of conditionnner\". (3 bottles are stashed in the bathroom. True story.) Saving money, time, mental energy.\n6. Less clutter means **less stress** about people coming over, losing things, running out of things, damaging things,...  I have enough stress with all the things I fail at already.\n7. Less clutter means it's **easier to clean**. \"Should I clean the kitchen today? But it's sooo much work...\" Every 2 days for 2 months. True story. (Noticed the 30 decisions that went to waste?)\n8. Uncluttering helps **overcome perfectionism**. Unless you'll make your place spotless (teach me, master!), you'll have to be content with something **\"good enough\"** or just \"well, at least it's **progress**\".\n\n### Some strategies for us ADHD-ers\n\n1. Set some simple rules so you don't overthink it. For example: \"always start with trash\". (Or laundry, because it takes time.) Consider following a cleaning schedule: if it's Tuesday, I'm cleaning the bathroom.\n2. UFYH recommends breaks: 20 min cleaning 10 min break, for example. Have a snack, because decision fatigue.\n3. UFYH recommends taking pictures to see your progress. I don't remember my room \"before\" well enough to see the improvement, so I can get discouraged easily. Enjoy the **progress**.\n4. A cool motivational thing is to invite people over. Who loves **the thrill of urgent work at the last minute**? We do!\n5. Konmari recommends working by **category, not location**, and storing things from the same category together. For example: my cookboks live in 2 places, kitchen and living room. \"Where should I put this book\" is a decision. \"What cook should I take today\" requires having to remember the other ones, not just looking at this one shelf. One book I had in duplicate.\n6. Konmari recommends a specific decision process where you do the **whole category**, take everything out, and see thing-by-thing if you want to keep it - the complete opposite of advice like \"toss one thing a day\". Let's imagine 50% of your things, you don't actually use. If you just look at the room and search for something to toss, chances are you'll pick 3% of you things and you'll always be living with the remaining 47%. \"My house is always cluttered no matter how hard I try, which scientifically proves I suck.\" Here's my take on that:\n    - **Try it** on an easy category like socks - something **personal**, **not shared**, and with **not too much sentimental attachement**. You'll see if seeing all the socks, touching that sock and seeing if you feel joy for having it makes the deciding easier.\n    - Beware of perfectionism here. Konmari says her method is perfect and you'll clean once for all -  there's a little bit of sales talk here. Many people on /r/konmari say they do 2, maybe even 3 iterations. Don't shoot for a perfect textbook konmari, rather err on the safe side: it will be huge progress already. You can always discard something later, do a second iteration when you know yourself better etc.\n    - It works, and it changes your shopping habits a lot. It teaches you to only buy things you find supa-dupa-awesome. It ruined the huge shopping during sales for me. :)\n7. Label the heck out of your boxes, drawers and whatnot. Why remember, why think \"what was my sorting system here again???\" when you can just look? \n8. You can have friends help you. When Konmari says to keep your cleaning secret, she mainly means women and their clothes and moms who try to salvage things. A friend can help is stay focused and make decisions.\n\n### More great advice\n\n1.

This isn&amp;#39;t a comprehensive guide top-to-bottom everything-you-need-to-know. (There are some links at the bottom for that.) This is some stuff useful for anyone, but mainly focused on our challenges. Add some if you have more! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s harder when you have ADHD&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weaker focus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weaker memory. (&amp;quot;Where did I put these keys again?&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weaker decision making.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue\"&gt;Decison fatigue&lt;/a&gt; is a thing: it means not only decisions make you tired, but the more you make, the weaker the next ones are. That&amp;#39;s why the jobs with many decisions are hard, stresfull and paid like a boss. The less you have to make, the better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I think we are more prone to decision fatigue. &amp;quot;Should I start horseback riding? Should I think about this now or try to re-focus on work?&amp;quot; Also, trying to take a decision, postponing it and doing it later counts as 2 decisions. (Or 3. Or more.) However, it&amp;#39;s more shots, but you only get one point.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perfectionism.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How can uncluttering help?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The clutter is talking&lt;/strong&gt; to me. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a wrapper, toss me!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a reciept, file me!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Get me home!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t forget me tomorrow!&amp;quot;. As if I needed more distractions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;One place for everything&amp;quot; means &lt;strong&gt;less searching and remembering&lt;/strong&gt;. I know where my keys are! :)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;One place for everything&amp;quot; means &lt;strong&gt;less decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;quot;Where should I put this pasta?&amp;quot; On the shelf with rice and pasta! :)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seeing what you have at a glance means having &lt;strong&gt;less to remember&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;quot;What should I wear today? With this top go with that skirt in the drawer or that one on the floor? I have nothing to wear!&amp;quot; Perfectly matching skirt was forgotten in the wardrobe.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seeing what you have at a glance means having &lt;strong&gt;less shopping&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;m running out of conditionnner&amp;quot;. (3 bottles are stashed in the bathroom. True story.) Saving money, time, mental energy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Less clutter means &lt;strong&gt;less stress&lt;/strong&gt; about people coming over, losing things, running out of things, damaging things,...  I have enough stress with all the things I fail at already.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Less clutter means it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;easier to clean&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;quot;Should I clean the kitchen today? But it&amp;#39;s sooo much work...&amp;quot; Every 2 days for 2 months. True story. (Noticed the 30 decisions that went to waste?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Uncluttering helps &lt;strong&gt;overcome perfectionism&lt;/strong&gt;. Unless you&amp;#39;ll make your place spotless (teach me, master!), you&amp;#39;ll have to be content with something &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or just &amp;quot;well, at least it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Some strategies for us ADHD-ers&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set some simple rules so you don&amp;#39;t overthink it. For example: &amp;quot;always start with trash&amp;quot;. (Or laundry, because it takes time.) Consider following a cleaning schedule: if it&amp;#39;s Tuesday, I&amp;#39;m cleaning the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UFYH recommends breaks: 20 min cleaning 10 min break, for example. Have a snack, because decision fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UFYH recommends taking pictures to see your progress. I don&amp;#39;t remember my room &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; well enough to see the improvement, so I can get discouraged easily. Enjoy the &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A cool motivational thing is to invite people over. Who loves &lt;strong&gt;the thrill of urgent work at the last minute&lt;/strong&gt;? We do!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Konmari recommends working by &lt;strong&gt;category, not location&lt;/strong&gt;, and storing things from the same category together. For example: my cookboks live in 2 places, kitchen and living room. &amp;quot;Where should I put this book&amp;quot; is a decision. &amp;quot;What cook should I take today&amp;quot; requires having to remember the other ones, not just looking at this one shelf. One book I had in duplicate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Konmari recommends a specific decision process where you do the &lt;strong&gt;whole category&lt;/strong&gt;, take everything out, and see thing-by-thing if you want to keep it - the complete opposite of advice like &amp;quot;toss one thing a day&amp;quot;. Let&amp;#39;s imagine 50% of your things, you don&amp;#39;t actually use. If you just look at the room and search for something to toss, chances are you&amp;#39;ll pick 3% of you things and you&amp;#39;ll always be living with the remaining 47%. &amp;quot;My house is always cluttered no matter how hard I try, which scientifically proves I suck.&amp;quot; Here&amp;#39;s my take on that:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it&lt;/strong&gt; on an easy category like socks - something &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;not shared&lt;/strong&gt;, and with &lt;strong&gt;not too much sentimental attachement&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll see if seeing all the socks, touching that sock and seeing if you feel joy for having it makes the deciding easier.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beware of perfectionism here. Konmari says her method is perfect and you&amp;#39;ll clean once for all -  there&amp;#39;s a little bit of sales talk here. Many people on &lt;a href=\"/r/konmari\"&gt;/r/konmari&lt;/a&gt; say they do 2, maybe even 3 iterations. Don&amp;#39;t shoot for a perfect textbook konmari, rather err on the safe side: it will be huge progress already. You can always discard something later, do a second iteration when you know yourself better etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It works, and it changes your shopping habits a lot. It teaches you to only buy things you find supa-dupa-awesome. It ruined the huge shopping during sales for me. :)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Label the heck out of your boxes, drawers and whatnot. Why remember, why think &amp;quot;what was my sorting system here again???&amp;quot; when you can just look? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can have friends help you. When Konmari says to keep your cleaning secret, she mainly means women and their clothes and moms who try to salvage things. A friend can help is stay focused and make decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;More great advice&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TGWeblZ0c8\"&gt;&amp;quot;Overwhelm Part One: How to Tackle the Clutter&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by How to ADHD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/\"&gt;Unf_ck your habitat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/declutter\"&gt;/r/declutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/konmari\"&gt;/r/konmari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

All of this is pushing me decision fatigue.\n\nI want to be able to just stop for a moment, but it is draining my energy even when I\u2019m \u201crelaxing\u201d so the mental exhaustion keeps building up.\n\nWhat have I been doing? 1) Going into the gym (after 2 years of hiatus due of multiple factors) and it has been draining a lot of daily willpower. 2) Journaling. 3) mediation (this is the hardest)\n\nWhat more can I do?\n\nThanks all",

We can struggle to form new habits. We can struggle with motivation. \n\nSo I thought I\u2019d share what worked for me. I went from being a 190 pound girl with chronic back pain, no strength, winded after climbing two flights of stairs to a 133 pound gym rat who no longer has back pain and can easily run 2-3 miles. \n\nTwo quick disclaimers: 1. I am not a professional. I\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m not a dietician, I\u2019m not a trainer. I\u2019m just a woman who has succeeded in this area. 2. I have a lot of advantages in this area. I\u2019m far from rich, but I have access to money. Some of what\u2019s worked for me depends on having access to money. Some of my tips will help anyone, but some of them require money. I\u2019m also single and childless, which are both HUGE time/freedom advantages. Again, some of my tips can apply to anyone, but I recognize not everything will work for everyone. \n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the tips:\n\n1. Pre-cooked and/or pre-cut healthier foods are worth their weight in gold. Tyson Grilled n Ready chicken breast, frozen pre-cut fruit, frozen steam in bag veggies. Even canned veggies and fruit (look for low sodium/low sugar versions!) at least get some fruits and veggies in your diet. This reduces the need to cook and clean up, and the number of steps needed to make healthy food. Pre-washed baby spinach or carrots are also good. \n\n2. Make healthy swaps for foods you already know how to prep. This is a super lazy way to make food healthier. You don\u2019t have to learn a whole new recipe. Just swap in extra lean ground turkey for ground beef, or frozen Greek yogurt for ice cream.  Even if it\u2019s still not the healthiest thing in the world, it\u2019s at least a little better for you. \n\n3. Minimize the junk you keep in your house. It is literally impossible to binge mindlessly on a food that doesn\u2019t exist. \n\n4. Get a personal trainer if you can. Of course, this is one of those \u201cI have access to time and money\u201d tips. If you can, I highly recommend it. They take the mental work out of some of your workouts. \n\n5. Plan meals ahead of time with a calculator in your hand to count calories and whatever macros you\u2019re focusing on for your goals. I plan a few days at a time so I don\u2019t get decision fatigue or get impulsive when the time comes to make food or eat. \n\n6. Make your workouts fun and encouraging. I LOVE the stair master at the gym because I can listen to motivational speeches or (for a small chunk of it) an audiobook. My mom used to read on the stair master. I also like the high energy fast paced classes at my gym, like HIIT or kickboxing. I also highly recommend weightlifting. You can change up the movements you do, so it doesn\u2019t get boring. It\u2019s also super motivating to look in the mirror. Your muscles getting more defined is a visible reminder that you are a beast. You get an easy, immediate sense of achievement just by glancing in the mirror. \n\n7. Measure out single serving containers or buy pre-packaged single serve containers to combat mindless eating. \n\n8. Stop making perfect the enemy of the good. This is probably the most important thing. Sometimes I eat a protein bar with artificial sweeteners. But at least I\u2019m getting a significant dose of protein. Sometimes I eat some Halo Top ice cream. But it\u2019s a carefully measured amount, so it\u2019s only 100 calories. Sometimes I eat canned veggies. But at least I\u2019m getting some in my diet. Once a week I have a cheat day. I\u2019m far from perfect. But I\u2019m so much better than I was before. \n\nDon\u2019t give up. I was a lost cause before I started.",

I was a lost cause before I started.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

What, if instead of being productive, as I hope, I waste yet another day in panic/decision fatigue/ADHD paralysis ? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s 1130 at night and I would have liked to been asleep, but I\u2019m not. Vyvanse has worn off which is probably why I am feeling so much, ADHD paralysis, but still, even medicated\u2014why is unstructured time so hard? I seriously feel like I need lower doses of medication at work and higher doses at home because of lack of structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I called a lot of testing facilities in my area (on a list given to me by my doctor.) and one called me back. An old man. He said he could get me in in less than 2 weeks, so I said yes.\n\nI finally got tested but it was so weird and unprofessional. Here's a summary of what happened:\n\n* The office was old and dusty. There was no one else in the building. Just me and this old man.\n* The whole thing took about 4 hours. Not kidding, at least 2 hours were spent on the old man talking about himself. \n* I learned more about the old man than about myself. He kept saying that HE has ADHD and that HE needs medication. Like bro! Which one of us is being tested right now? What the fuck!\n* I took a few memory tests and one computer test. Then I took a personality disorder screening test. \n* The old man had moments of lucidity where he would stop talking about himself and say something about me. He said I am very smart, that I have inattentive ADHD, and that I am very depressed and too hard on myself. This was not an official report though. Nor did he recommend any coping strategies\n* He told me to call in about a week or two to pick up my results (in person I assume because he won't use email.)  I haven't done this yet because honestly, I feel so discouraged and I don't want to see him again I will try to call later today. \n\nOverall, I feel discouraged and kind of angry. I know I will be billed for this visit. I wanted to get tested because I wanted to learn about myself, not some old man three breaths away from retirement. If I wasn't so frustrated, this would be pretty funny. \n\nI've never tried ADHD medication. My therapist told me I need to try to get on ADHD meds because my coping strategies aren't working anymore. Every day I struggle to function and I constantly suffer from decision fatigue.\n\nI don't trust this old man and now I feel like I need to start all over again. I just feel discouraged.",

I called a lot of testing facilities in my area (on a list given to me by my doctor.) and one called me back. An old man. He said he could get me in in less than 2 weeks, so I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally got tested but it was so weird and unprofessional. Here&amp;#39;s a summary of what happened:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The office was old and dusty. There was no one else in the building. Just me and this old man.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The whole thing took about 4 hours. Not kidding, at least 2 hours were spent on the old man talking about himself. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I learned more about the old man than about myself. He kept saying that HE has ADHD and that HE needs medication. Like bro! Which one of us is being tested right now? What the fuck!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I took a few memory tests and one computer test. Then I took a personality disorder screening test. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The old man had moments of lucidity where he would stop talking about himself and say something about me. He said I am very smart, that I have inattentive ADHD, and that I am very depressed and too hard on myself. This was not an official report though. Nor did he recommend any coping strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He told me to call in about a week or two to pick up my results (in person I assume because he won&amp;#39;t use email.)  I haven&amp;#39;t done this yet because honestly, I feel so discouraged and I don&amp;#39;t want to see him again I will try to call later today. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I feel discouraged and kind of angry. I know I will be billed for this visit. I wanted to get tested because I wanted to learn about myself, not some old man three breaths away from retirement. If I wasn&amp;#39;t so frustrated, this would be pretty funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never tried ADHD medication. My therapist told me I need to try to get on ADHD meds because my coping strategies aren&amp;#39;t working anymore. Every day I struggle to function and I constantly suffer from decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t trust this old man and now I feel like I need to start all over again. I just feel discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I hate hurting her like this.**\n\nI'm new to my diagnosis (33 yo, ADHD-I), but not new to disappointing my wife.  Her birthday is in a week and I have had a dinner reservation for a couple weeks (a win), I've scheduled a smash cake for her which is something she's talked about for other peoples birthday plans (another win) and I've reached out to friends to see if they were available to come over (another win).\n\nUnfortunately, a couple wins isn't enough.  \n\nShe told me months ago all she wants to do is get away somewhere and feel like an adult instead of a parent.  I knew this is what she wanted.  Two months ago (pre-diagnosis) I was SO SURE that this time was going to be different.  I was going to start now and make it happen.\n\nYou know the rest.  The decision fatigue, lack of executive function and paralysis on just trying to figure out a date, a (COVID safe and pregnancy friendly) place, a way for our kid to be taken care of in our absence, and fun stuff to do for someone who is pregnant stopped me from making any good progress.  Money has been a little tight too, which added to the stress.  I thought about it everyday, stressed about it everyday, but \\*couldn't\\* make decisions, and get things done.\n\nToday before leaving to spend some time with her mom, I said \"can I ask you about your birthday\" and proceeded to double check if she'd like to have a handful of friends over, especially because not all of them could come.  That's when we had the same \"fight/discussion\" we've had a bajillion times before.  She knew this was coming, I had forgotten to do what she wanted, or not even listened to her, and she wasn't going to get what she asked for (and deserved).  Basically, my actions say I don't care.  My actions show that her happiness isn't important.  My actions have hurt her.\n\nShe's not wrong.  Yes, ADHD is 100% a factor here in my brain, but I'm still not absolved from responsibility.  I know I'm like this, and I have yet to find good strategies to push through the paralysis and make good choices, before it comes to tears.  Now I'm scrambling to put together a weekend she deserves, since the gear has shifted from important to urgent.\n\nI just wanted to say this out loud to some people who get it.  I \\*have\\* to get better, she deserves the kind of experiences she creates for she people she loves.\n\nI start Vyvanse on Saturday, and I'm hoping it will help with some of the focus, task completion and decision making, but I know it's not a miracle and the work is still mine to do.\n\nThanks for listening, good luck with your hurdles today.",

Diagnosed literally last week.  I hate hurting her like this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to my diagnosis (33 yo, ADHD-I), but not new to disappointing my wife.  Her birthday is in a week and I have had a dinner reservation for a couple weeks (a win), I&amp;#39;ve scheduled a smash cake for her which is something she&amp;#39;s talked about for other peoples birthday plans (another win) and I&amp;#39;ve reached out to friends to see if they were available to come over (another win).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a couple wins isn&amp;#39;t enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me months ago all she wants to do is get away somewhere and feel like an adult instead of a parent.  I knew this is what she wanted.  Two months ago (pre-diagnosis) I was SO SURE that this time was going to be different.  I was going to start now and make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know the rest.  The decision fatigue, lack of executive function and paralysis on just trying to figure out a date, a (COVID safe and pregnancy friendly) place, a way for our kid to be taken care of in our absence, and fun stuff to do for someone who is pregnant stopped me from making any good progress.  Money has been a little tight too, which added to the stress.  I thought about it everyday, stressed about it everyday, but *couldn&amp;#39;t* make decisions, and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today before leaving to spend some time with her mom, I said &amp;quot;can I ask you about your birthday&amp;quot; and proceeded to double check if she&amp;#39;d like to have a handful of friends over, especially because not all of them could come.  That&amp;#39;s when we had the same &amp;quot;fight/discussion&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;ve had a bajillion times before.  She knew this was coming, I had forgotten to do what she wanted, or not even listened to her, and she wasn&amp;#39;t going to get what she asked for (and deserved).  Basically, my actions say I don&amp;#39;t care.  My actions show that her happiness isn&amp;#39;t important.  My actions have hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s not wrong.  Yes, ADHD is 100% a factor here in my brain, but I&amp;#39;m still not absolved from responsibility.  I know I&amp;#39;m like this, and I have yet to find good strategies to push through the paralysis and make good choices, before it comes to tears.  Now I&amp;#39;m scrambling to put together a weekend she deserves, since the gear has shifted from important to urgent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to say this out loud to some people who get it.  I *have* to get better, she deserves the kind of experiences she creates for she people she loves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start Vyvanse on Saturday, and I&amp;#39;m hoping it will help with some of the focus, task completion and decision making, but I know it&amp;#39;s not a miracle and the work is still mine to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening, good luck with your hurdles today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I don\u2019t have a lot of unscheduled free time at work during usual business hours. When I do, I have a much harder time with ADHD issues than the days where my whole day is scheduled / packed with meetings/scheduled things. My work is interesting/pleasantly challenging which also helps, but I really think having almost every hour accounted for is what actually helps me. Less decisions and less room for executive dysfunction. For what it\u2019s worth, school was similar for me, the structure / deadlines/accountability/competing with others was exactly what I needed to do well. And both school and now my job give me that. \n\nUntil the evening, when I leave work, and suddenly have no structure\u2014 the free time is actually harder for me. Same with weekends and holidays/other days off. Suddenly it\u2019s like I need to be parented, I don\u2019t know how to handle the unscheduled time. The lack of structure actually gives me decision, fatigue, like I don\u2019t know what to do with this time and how to get housework done or catch up on things or even hobbies/relaxing are difficult for me. That\u2019s when I feel the ADHD executive dysfunction the most, not at work. \n\nAn analogy is that at work, that\u2019s like walking on the people movers at the airports, you have to go straight because there\u2019s no other way to go and even if you stand still it still moves you. At home, that analogy is like me walking in circles and zigzags, and not actually getting  anywhere even though I am moving around. \n\nI sometimes wonder if I could get away with a lower dose of Adderall at work, or maybe not even at all. But at home I\u2019m almost useless without it. I don\u2019t skip weekends. I need my full prescribed dose unless I want to lay around on the couch all day and not even be able to focus on / enjoy a TV show or movie. I\u2019m actually considering making my two days per week without it on weekdays, but I haven\u2019t actually tried that\u2014when my lunchtime dose wears off, then it\u2019s wearing off JUST as I\u2019m getting home when I most need it. And then I am essentially useless, unless I take an evening dose. And by useless, I mean, I can\u2019t get anything done around the house and can\u2019t/won\u2019t even do my hobbies / stuff I want to. (Example is that it\u2019s garbage night and I guess I\u2019m just not putting mine out for tomorrow because I don\u2019t have the motivation or executive function to get a bag, gather the garbage from the rooms, put it in the container and walk it to the curb. Fine, but I didn\u2019t do anything else or anythin fun instead though. Lost several hours on Reddit.)\n\nTLDR: my ADHD is actually way better at work and becomes most problematic at home without any structure.",

I feel like a background program that is just expected to function and take care of things. I plan and execute all but one meal a week. I handle all things kids related. I plan all the schedules. I attend all the events. I take everyone to all their different therapies(speech &amp; ot). I am in charge of all activities and appointments. Until recently I also basically ran cousin's life(she just got out of a controlling dv relationship and learning to adult)  I'm having a really hard day and I need to express that. I don't know how to express that in a healthy helpful way.\nI spent the entire weekend camping with my kids at my parents. We had a fabulous time. But it's draining. Their dad stayed at home (which is a prior agreement so perfectly acceptable). Usually on his weekend off, he goes up and stays at his mom's. On my weekend off, he takes the kids up there and I stay at our house. I spend my weekends cleaning. Getting everything caught up. \nThis weekend he ran the dishwasher. He said he was going to get things done. I expected to walk into the house last night and find at least one room clean. Nothing was changed except the dishes in the dishwasher were clean.  \nHow is it I'm the one with ADHD and the only one getting anything done?",

I'm not here to say that. However, I *am* here to recommend having regular sleeping and waking times if you can, for your overall wellbeing and productivity! I've been feeling absolutely shit and exhausted for the last few months, and also found out I may have cancer so I have to wait for a colonoscopy, all of which has taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health. Not to mention the ever-present shackles of ADHD lol. So I decided to try Something which I haven't tried in a really long time: a sleep schedule. And let me tell you, I'm only on day 4 and I feel so much better! I have a little ritual before bed where I do some light stretches or yoga for a few minutes, then I massage some lavender oil moisturiser into my skin (seriously - this stuff works wonders for relaxing). I read from a slightly boring but not too boring book, and I do a quick breathing exercise. And most importantly: I LEAVE MY PHONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. For two reasons. One: I'm not tempted to use it if I'm struggling to get to sleep, and two: when my alarm goes off in the morning I HAVE to get up to turn it off. I try and have some clothes laid out or easy to get to so I can get dressed right away. This helps me to get into a productive mindset, rather than lounging around in my PJs. I also try not to use my phone at all until I've done some yoga and had breakfast.\n\nAnyway I'm getting so off track lol. My point is, going to bed and waking up at the same time has done wonders for my overall organisation and mood. I don't feel super groggy like I used to, and having a routine gets rid of decision fatigue which usually takes up so much of my time. I'd highly recommend it if you have a similar problem!",

Even cleaned the kitchen after that. Somehow I'm still motivated again today and cleaned the rest of the apartment! Have you ever noticed a difference between generic and name brand Adderall?\n\n9 times out of 10, when I clean my room, I end up leaving a small pile behind because I simply feel like I can not go any further. It's like I get overwhelmed with decision fatigue from cleaning up everything else that I always end up with areas in my room I just deem \"good enough.\" the problem is, this can go on for months without me dealing with the little piles. I end up with 4 or 5 piles of random crap and I just can't get myself to put it all away.\n\nUntil yesterday. I don't even know how I did it, but I just got up out of bed and got in the shower, with absolutely no struggle at all (this is rare). When I got out and got dressed I stood there and looked at my unmade bed for a minute, and just thought, \"man, I really don't wanna get back in bed (where I have been a lot in the last month, considering I broke my leg and have been unable to do anything all summer).\" I made my bed, then looked over at my nightstand, which had a few coffee cups and other random things that didn\u2019t belong there, so I cleaned that up too. Somehow the motivation kept coming, and slowly but surely, I got to each pile and put everything where it belongs. I even organized the drawers of my nightstand and desk.\n\nIt's so refreshing to have a clean space. It wasn't what I would call \"dirty\" or even overly messy, it was still tidy, just with a few spots of organized chaos. But I feel so much lighter looking at those spots and not seeing the mess that was there for a month or more.\n\nSomehow when I was done (even thought it somehow took 4+ hours to completely organize my room) I even moved on to the kitchen. Did the dishes, wiped off the counters, cleaned the stove and swept the floor. I honestly have no idea where this motivation came from honestly, as I've been struggling with it for a bit of time now.\n\nI recently switched from generic Adderall to the name brand... I'm curious if this has anything to do with it. Because today I was still motivated enough to clean the living room and dining room too. Anyone have any input on this? Do you feel like the name brand works better?\n\nAnyway, just thought I'd share. I know a lot of you can relate, and maybe this can serve as some motivation for someone else to get up and get going and clean up their place. I know it can be hard to get yourself going but my god, the feeling you get when you're finally done is so, so sweet.",

During a painful performance review, my supervisor told me that I sometimes give off the impression that I was distracted, uncaring, and abrupt during calls.\n\nAs I look for a new headset, I have become overwhelmed by decision fatigue (tears included). \n\nI hope this post is okay; I figure this community would understand the importance of a headset. I need to concentrate on a crisis line call, which means having a wireless headset that covers both my ears. It would also be helpful if it were noise-canceling (I have very talkative cats who are still upset by a closed-door). The headset would also need to have a microphone as I work in a call-center position. Thank you in advance for any suggestions.",

During a painful performance review, my supervisor told me that I sometimes give off the impression that I was distracted, uncaring, and abrupt during calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I look for a new headset, I have become overwhelmed by decision fatigue (tears included). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this post is okay; I figure this community would understand the importance of a headset. I need to concentrate on a crisis line call, which means having a wireless headset that covers both my ears. It would also be helpful if it were noise-canceling (I have very talkative cats who are still upset by a closed-door). The headset would also need to have a microphone as I work in a call-center position. Thank you in advance for any suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Still not there completely, but I wanted to share a few things I found over the last two years.\n\nBreakfast:\n\nI have two options: cereal or toast with 2-3 things to put on top. This minimizes decision fatigue before I even start the day but still provides calories, fiber and nutrients (to a certain degree).\n\nLunch:\n\nI live alone and uni is mostly online still, so I need to cook. Or do I? If I'm not in the mood or don't have time, I eat toast. I also keep noodle cups for a quick warm meal.\n\nDinner:\n\nI'm German, so when all else fails, it's bread once again. I stock this up with cut veggies.\n\nIf I do cook, I cook at least two portions so I can have leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nI always have base ingredients (rice, pasta) and sauces (packets or ready made) at home. These can be easily leveled up with veggies or meat if I feel like cooking but are also made quickly and with little effort (cook rice/pasta, drain, add in sauce, let sauce warm up).\n\nThis year I want to try my hand at meal prepping to use high energy days for preparation and benefit on low energy days.\n\nSnacks:\n\nI keep squeeze pouches next to my desk, easy snacks (cheese, pudding) in the fridge and easy prep fruit and veg (mostly apples, bell peppers, cucumber, mini tomatoes) on the counter.\n\nOne thing I found helps me sleep is having a peanut butter sandwich or something similar before going to bed.\n\nDrinks:\n\nI found a water bottle brand I like and have a few of their bottles to fill up with water. I'll buy flavored water or juices to stretch.\n\nI ALWAYS keep my bottle ON my desk, to have a visual reminder to drink.",

Still not there completely, but I wanted to share a few things I found over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have two options: cereal or toast with 2-3 things to put on top. This minimizes decision fatigue before I even start the day but still provides calories, fiber and nutrients (to a certain degree).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live alone and uni is mostly online still, so I need to cook. Or do I? If I&amp;#39;m not in the mood or don&amp;#39;t have time, I eat toast. I also keep noodle cups for a quick warm meal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m German, so when all else fails, it&amp;#39;s bread once again. I stock this up with cut veggies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I do cook, I cook at least two portions so I can have leftovers for lunch the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always have base ingredients (rice, pasta) and sauces (packets or ready made) at home. These can be easily leveled up with veggies or meat if I feel like cooking but are also made quickly and with little effort (cook rice/pasta, drain, add in sauce, let sauce warm up).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year I want to try my hand at meal prepping to use high energy days for preparation and benefit on low energy days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snacks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep squeeze pouches next to my desk, easy snacks (cheese, pudding) in the fridge and easy prep fruit and veg (mostly apples, bell peppers, cucumber, mini tomatoes) on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I found helps me sleep is having a peanut butter sandwich or something similar before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drinks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a water bottle brand I like and have a few of their bottles to fill up with water. I&amp;#39;ll buy flavored water or juices to stretch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ALWAYS keep my bottle ON my desk, to have a visual reminder to drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Limit decision making the day of, to prevent decision fatigue. Dress to limit distractions, and pack what you need to deal with the unpreventable ones. Anticipate how your brain and body are going to handle this.**\n\nI just sat a board exam for medical coding and wanted to share some general testing tips with you guys. My specific exam was 150 multiple choice questions, and examinees are given 5 hour and 40 minutes to complete in one shot. I did look into accommodations to allow for more time, but those proctor sessions are few and far between, so I just made sure to prepare really well, take my meds, and do the best with what I had. \n\nI posted an in-depth, test-specific review and recommendations to /r/medicalcoding but I think a lot of this can apply in general to those of us with ADHD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Studying for the test:** I had a really long window between finishing the courses and sitting the exams, and a lot of other important things that kept me separated from the material. I'd last attended a study session on 10/2 and taken a mock exam on 10/9, and honestly hadn't touched much of this until the exam on 12/20 - so I was separated from the material for around 9 weeks. I tried to review the material at home, but you know how it is with kids and partners. Even if you explain that you need some time alone to study, deliveries still come and you still have to remind them to shower and the damn ingrates think they're entitled to be fed literally three times a day, ugh. So... **I straight up left my family.** I went to stay at a cheap hotel near the testing site 2 nights before my exam, and it was **THE BEST THING I COULD HAVE DONE FOR MYSELF.** I used the extra day to do all of the uninterrupted studying I needed to do, and honestly I'm not sure I would've passed without the silent time to run through practice exams and make sure I felt like I'd touched all of the material sections and I was confident in my pace of answering. The advice I've read says to stay away from the material the day before the test, but you do what you've got to do.\n* **Getting to the exam:** We weren't allowed to bring phones or smart watches into the building, so I recommend that you print out the information from the proctor that includes their phone numbers and directions to find the testing room within the building. I realize that if I needed to actually call one of them, I would've had to walk back to my car and turn my phone back on. The important thing was that I did not need to utilize any of my head space trying to remember which floor to go to, which turn to take, and which room number to find.\n* I'd heard that we were permitted to bring highlighters and rulers into the exam room with us. The proctors had no issues with anything I brought in. The integral things I brought that I am really glad I had, were multiple rulers and a booklet of tabs.  \n\n   * I used my three rulers to mark the manual pages I may need to refer back to while completing each question, to make flipping faster when I was comparing codes from multiple sections.\n   * I used tabs to mark the questions that stumped me in the test booklet, so I could refer back to them later without having to scan the whole booklet again. I removed the tabs before turning the booklet in, but I don't think it would've been an issue if I hadn't.\n   * I used my highlighter in the test booklet to mark pertinent information within longer scenarios as I read them, so that I didn't have to try to remember what was happening in the question.\n* **Strategizing how to prioritize questions:** Know ahead of time which sections are going to be your strong suits and what pace you expect to keep. The scantron for my exam was laid out in 5 columns of 30 questions each. My goal was to complete roughly one column per hour. I usually use a smart watch, which wouldn't be allowed, so I bought a digital watch from WalMart ($8.88) for the occasion. I laid the watch out on the table in front of me, so I could glance at the clock without having to stop writing to turn my wrist. I used the front of the test booklet to label the time I finished each column so I'd know how ahead or behind I was.\n* **After you finish:** I finished the questions with about a half hour left. I wish I'd had a plan of what to do with leftover time if I had any. I feel like I wasted time trying to decide how to use it. First I went through the scantron to make sure I'd marked an answer for all of the questions - and I'm glad I did, because I missed two. So I answered those, and then went back through the questions I'd tabbed to make sure I was still happy with the answers I chose. Finally, I went through the booklet and scantron to make sure that the answers I'd marked in the scantron matched up with what I'd checked off in my booklet. I wasn't done with this check before time was called.\n* **Consider what you're wearing:** I made sure that my bra was comfortable, my sweat pants were warm but not hot, and I wore layers of loose clothing. Think through it - it's likely that your testing room isn't used on a daily basis, so it may be cold when you get in and the proctors may hike the thermostat to try to get it warm faster, and then you'll be hot. Layer up, in clothes that are loose and comfortable and not distracting. The night before, I applied cuticle oil so that I hopefully wouldn't be chewing on hangnails and such. The day of, I put my hair up in a secure bun and wore a comfortable fabric headband so flyaways wouldn't distract me, and skipped the jewelry I knew I'd fidget with. I was probably the frumpiest I've been in public for a long time, but I wasn't distracted by my clothes or uncomfortable in the environment.\n\n**What I brought into the testing room with me:**\n\n* **Bag #1: School supplies**  \n\n   * **What I used:** 3x presharpened standard #2 pencils, 2 rulers, digital watch, 1 highlighter, 1 pack of tabs, separate eraser, pencil cup\n   * **What I didn't use but would bring a second time:** pencil sharpener, calculator\n   * **What I brought, didn't need, and wouldn't bother bringing next time:** pens, mechanical pencils, glasses to reduce eye strain, extra highlighters, tabs, and erasers\n* **Bag # 2: Personal care stuff**  \n\n   * **General tips:** I have ADHD and I'm a picker, particularly when I'm stressed and anxious. So I brought stuff to make sure that, should anything happen to or on my body that bothered me, I could just address it quickly and finally, without spending the rest of the time chewing myself into a bleeding distracted mess.\n   * **What I used:** ear plugs (I've heard mixed reviews from others about whether these are beneficial, but they were critical for me!!! I never once worried about how fast someone else was flipping through their manuals or got distracted by what they were eating, etc.)\n   * **What I didn't use but would bring a second time:**\n      * Eyes: prescription glasses, eye drops, spare contact lenses and spare case\n      * Ears: second pair of ear plugs in case the first started to hurt, ear swabs\n      * Mouth: dental floss/picks, single use toothbrushes\n      * Hair: bobby pins, hair elastic\n      * Stuff to deal with picking/distractions / random stuff: nail/cuticle clippers, cuticle oil, hand lotion, tweezers, scissors, magnifying mirror, kleenex, roller ball for muscles, wrist brace\n      * Meds: Aleve, Neosporin, AfterBite, DayQuil, Hydrocortisone, Aquaphor lip stuff, Lorazepam prescribed by my psychiatrist for the occasion, Miconazole (because of COURSE I got a yeast infection like 4 days before my exam ugh)\n   * **What I brought, didn't need, and wouldn't bother bringing next time:** spare face mask, glasses for eye strain\n* **Bag # 3: Snacks and bevvies**  \n\n   * **General tips:** open all the plastic wraps and ziplock baggies before the exam starts. Make sure you have some napkins and spoons, whatever is necessary. Skip the stuff that's going to get your fingers nasty, you don't want cheeto dust on your answer sheet. Don't overenergize and get jittery - I opted for black tea over coffee and I'm glad I did. Eat to maintain your energy and focus. Think sustenance over mindless snacking, and think of how you'll be eating it - I chose slim fast and liquid yogurt because I could get some decent calories and low-sugar protein in a drinkable (i.e. one-handed, non-dominant hand) form that I didn't really have to pay attention to.\n   * **What I used:** I brought a chai tea in with me. I also used 1 Crystal Lite energy drink packet in a 32 oz bottle of water, and drank a Slim Fast. I ate 2 reeses trees, 1 before and 1 after the exam. I ate a container of Chobani yogurt and had a couple dried apricots.\n   * **What I didn't use but would bring a second time:** Hard candy in case of coughing, gum to help keep me awake and focused, cashews, grapes, peanut butter M&amp;Ms, salty snack like pretzel sticks\n   * **What I brought, didn't need, and wouldn't bother bringing next time:** too many extra choices. I wish I'd brought 1 salty snack instead of having 3 options. Same with multiple types of nuts, candies, etc.. I know myself and how decision fatigue already impacts me; I should've known to only bring 1 option of each type of snack and save the decision making for the test answers.\n\nGood luck to all of you planning to sit an exam in the future!",

I usually use a smart watch, which wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed, so I bought a digital watch from WalMart ($8.88) for the occasion. I laid the watch out on the table in front of me, so I could glance at the clock without having to stop writing to turn my wrist. I used the front of the test booklet to label the time I finished each column so I&amp;#39;d know how ahead or behind I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After you finish:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished the questions with about a half hour left. I wish I&amp;#39;d had a plan of what to do with leftover time if I had any. I feel like I wasted time trying to decide how to use it. First I went through the scantron to make sure I&amp;#39;d marked an answer for all of the questions - and I&amp;#39;m glad I did, because I missed two. So I answered those, and then went back through the questions I&amp;#39;d tabbed to make sure I was still happy with the answers I chose. Finally, I went through the booklet and scantron to make sure that the answers I&amp;#39;d marked in the scantron matched up with what I&amp;#39;d checked off in my booklet. I wasn&amp;#39;t done with this check before time was called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider what you&amp;#39;re wearing:&lt;/strong&gt; I made sure that my bra was comfortable, my sweat pants were warm but not hot, and I wore layers of loose clothing. Think through it - it&amp;#39;s likely that your testing room isn&amp;#39;t used on a daily basis, so it may be cold when you get in and the proctors may hike the thermostat to try to get it warm faster, and then you&amp;#39;ll be hot. Layer up, in clothes that are loose and comfortable and not distracting. The night before, I applied cuticle oil so that I hopefully wouldn&amp;#39;t be chewing on hangnails and such. The day of, I put my hair up in a secure bun and wore a comfortable fabric headband so flyaways wouldn&amp;#39;t distract me, and skipped the jewelry I knew I&amp;#39;d fidget with. I was probably the frumpiest I&amp;#39;ve been in public for a long time, but I wasn&amp;#39;t distracted by my clothes or uncomfortable in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I brought into the testing room with me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag #1: School supplies&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I used:&lt;/strong&gt; 3x presharpened standard #2 pencils, 2 rulers, digital watch, 1 highlighter, 1 pack of tabs, separate eraser, pencil cup&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t use but would bring a second time:&lt;/strong&gt; pencil sharpener, calculator&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I brought, didn&amp;#39;t need, and wouldn&amp;#39;t bother bringing next time:&lt;/strong&gt; pens, mechanical pencils, glasses to reduce eye strain, extra highlighters, tabs, and erasers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag # 2: Personal care stuff&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General tips:&lt;/strong&gt; I have ADHD and I&amp;#39;m a picker, particularly when I&amp;#39;m stressed and anxious. So I brought stuff to make sure that, should anything happen to or on my body that bothered me, I could just address it quickly and finally, without spending the rest of the time chewing myself into a bleeding distracted mess.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I used:&lt;/strong&gt; ear plugs (I&amp;#39;ve heard mixed reviews from others about whether these are beneficial, but they were critical for me!!! I never once worried about how fast someone else was flipping through their manuals or got distracted by what they were eating, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t use but would bring a second time:&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eyes: prescription glasses, eye drops, spare contact lenses and spare case&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ears: second pair of ear plugs in case the first started to hurt, ear swabs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mouth: dental floss/picks, single use toothbrushes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hair: bobby pins, hair elastic&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stuff to deal with picking/distractions / random stuff: nail/cuticle clippers, cuticle oil, hand lotion, tweezers, scissors, magnifying mirror, kleenex, roller ball for muscles, wrist brace&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meds: Aleve, Neosporin, AfterBite, DayQuil, Hydrocortisone, Aquaphor lip stuff, Lorazepam prescribed by my psychiatrist for the occasion, Miconazole (because of COURSE I got a yeast infection like 4 days before my exam ugh)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I brought, didn&amp;#39;t need, and wouldn&amp;#39;t bother bringing next time:&lt;/strong&gt; spare face mask, glasses for eye strain&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag # 3: Snacks and bevvies&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General tips:&lt;/strong&gt; open all the plastic wraps and ziplock baggies before the exam starts. Make sure you have some napkins and spoons, whatever is necessary. Skip the stuff that&amp;#39;s going to get your fingers nasty, you don&amp;#39;t want cheeto dust on your answer sheet. Don&amp;#39;t overenergize and get jittery - I opted for black tea over coffee and I&amp;#39;m glad I did. Eat to maintain your energy and focus. Think sustenance over mindless snacking, and think of how you&amp;#39;ll be eating it - I chose slim fast and liquid yogurt because I could get some decent calories and low-sugar protein in a drinkable (i.e. one-handed, non-dominant hand) form that I didn&amp;#39;t really have to pay attention to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I used:&lt;/strong&gt; I brought a chai tea in with me. I also used 1 Crystal Lite energy drink packet in a 32 oz bottle of water, and drank a Slim Fast. I ate 2 reeses trees, 1 before and 1 after the exam. I ate a container of Chobani yogurt and had a couple dried apricots.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I didn&amp;#39;t use but would bring a second time:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard candy in case of coughing, gum to help keep me awake and focused, cashews, grapes, peanut butter M&amp;amp;Ms, salty snack like pretzel sticks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I brought, didn&amp;#39;t need, and wouldn&amp;#39;t bother bringing next time:&lt;/strong&gt; too many extra choices. I wish I&amp;#39;d brought 1 salty snack instead of having 3 options. Same with multiple types of nuts, candies, etc.. I know myself and how decision fatigue already impacts me; I should&amp;#39;ve known to only bring 1 option of each type of snack and save the decision making for the test answers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all of you planning to sit an exam in the future!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I attributed most of our early arguments to immaturity and learning how to live on our own. I went through financial hardships growing up so I\u2019ve always been better with money, very good at home making, cooking, shopping, planning, the whole nine yards. He was an all star athlete in high school and swindled his way through high school and basically never had to put the work into anything because he was a gifted athlete and had people to do other work for him or just let it slide.\n\nHe basically lived every aspect of his life like this. I come from a house with a stay home mom so I kind of fell into that when we moved in together BUT I also worked 40 hours a week and went to college full time. He was a drop out, worked 1 day a week, and smoked all day playing video games. \n\nI used to think he just had an inflated ego, lazy, and incredibly selfish but 3 months ago he was diagnosed with severe ADHD and was prescribed vyvanse. I also read the book \u201cThe ADHD effect on marriage\u201d. The book resonated deeply with me.\n\nThere\u2019s something so good and kind about him that I fell in love with and so I married him early on. We\u2019ve been having trouble, in varying degrees, of getting him to contribute more without me having to ask or walk him through it. We worked really hard and he now has an amazing job that pays great and will set us up for life (I\u2019m still finishing college). \n\nI hate feeling like the nagging wife, but it\u2019s so hard to constantly see little things and wonder why the hell it doesn\u2019t occur to him to take care of them. I try and keep the adhd in mind and be patient but I\u2019m so young and I can only imagine how much will be on my plate when kids and a mortgage are involved.\n\nHe\u2019s a great listener. If I have work I\u2019ll send him a good morning text and a few things I want to get taken care of and they will 100% be taken care of while I\u2019m gone. If we\u2019re home and I ask him to do something he\u2019s on it. I even framed a cute chore list in our living room so he can reference. I get so tired of holding his hand through things...I wish he would notice the full trash and take it out. The full laundry he just threw his dirty clothes into and start a load. The unmade bed and make it. The empty pet food bowls and fill them. The empty fridge and go shopping. \n\nMy question is do I just have to be patient and understand that I\u2019m married to someone with adhd and probably won\u2019t ever really recognize tasks, chores, errands, and responsibilities like I do? Or are there better ways I can help him learn to help me. My decision fatigue is weighing on me. I\u2019m so tired of doing the thinking for two people all the time. Any advice is welcome thank you! \n\nTL:DR; my husband with ADHD rarely recognizes when household chores, responsibilities need to be done but listens very well when I ask. I don\u2019t want to guide him through things any more is there any advice on getting him to help around the house more on his own accord?",

I have never worked for Costco and I don\u2019t know anyone who does. \n\n**Costco Combats Decision Fatigue**\n\nAt a regular grocery store I get caught up in the weeds of all the product offerings with their variations. Size, nutritional value, flavors, price per oz, name brand differences vs store brand. At a normal store I get overwhelmed with options and it takes me minutes to select the best tomato sauce, cereal, or even egg carton. The product saturation add up to more time shopping and decision fatigue. I am exhausted by the end of the trip. \n\nNot so at Costco. They do all the pre-vetting for you. They will only carry industry leading brands, and their Kirkland store brand is of comparable quality or better. I don\u2019t have to decide which canned tomato to buy, I just need to decide whether I want canned tomatoes or not. It\u2019s not a multi-part decision. This saves me time and mental strain. I also know I can return anything I don\u2019t like which makes the decision to buy something even simpler. \n\n**Costco vs Amazon**\n\nObviously, Amazon has a better online platform and more options, better prices, better shipping fulfillment. But on Amazon I get overwhelmed with options, vendors, and possible forgeries/ fake reviews. I am an Amazon subscriber as well (who isn\u2019t) and it took me forever to decide on which charging cable to buy for my phone. I can\u2019t tell which is going to be the most durable and affordable option (the *best buy*, if you will). \n\nCostco\u2019s online site really sucks. However, the products they carry are almost always pre-vetted for quality. They also have a generous return policy and will stop carrying a product with too many complaints. \n\n**The Benefits of Buying in Bulk** \n\nBuying in bulk is more affordable, but that\u2019s not what this is about. The ability to buy in bulk means less shopping trips and less times I will run into a paper product shortage, or laundry detergent shortage. Pre-Costco I would always kick myself for forgetting to stock up on essentials, and it happened a lot. Buying in bulk means I get more time between these fuck ups. A true blessing. \n\nI lost my train of thought. That is all, folks.",

I also know I can return anything I don\u2019t like which makes the decision to buy something even simpler. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco vs Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Amazon has a better online platform and more options, better prices, better shipping fulfillment. But on Amazon I get overwhelmed with options, vendors, and possible forgeries/ fake reviews. I am an Amazon subscriber as well (who isn\u2019t) and it took me forever to decide on which charging cable to buy for my phone. I can\u2019t tell which is going to be the most durable and affordable option (the &lt;em&gt;best buy&lt;/em&gt;, if you will). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Costco\u2019s online site really sucks. However, the products they carry are almost always pre-vetted for quality. They also have a generous return policy and will stop carrying a product with too many complaints. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Benefits of Buying in Bulk&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buying in bulk is more affordable, but that\u2019s not what this is about. The ability to buy in bulk means less shopping trips and less times I will run into a paper product shortage, or laundry detergent shortage. Pre-Costco I would always kick myself for forgetting to stock up on essentials, and it happened a lot. Buying in bulk means I get more time between these fuck ups. A true blessing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost my train of thought. That is all, folks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I also find the environment of a mall or grocery store to be super exhausting and I get decision fatigue. I've found with ordering online I can just add things to the basket as I remember them or find recipes throughout the week and then submit the order when I'm ready :)\n\n- Started back at the gym and have made a competition with a friend to attend x many sessions a week \n\n- Set up my desk space and bought new pens that I love, + ergonomic mouse and keypad so I'm super comfy and look forward to being in that space \n\n- Have some money set aside for appointments with my psych so I'm not scrounging for it when I forget I have an appointment and it pops up on my schedule :')\nI have seen a clinical psychologist for the past 5 months and he came to the conclusion fairly early I have adhd and some associated depression. I have been on a waitlist for the final assessment by the psychiatrist which is coming up very soon and I'm really hoping that regular medication can help me. Wish me luck!\n\nThis is my final year and final term of undergrad and kind of the deciding point (grades wise) as to whether a post grad school will take me.\nI'm really trying to stay positive because the truth is after so many cycles of burnout and depression I lost some faith in myself. I haven't been able to achieve consistency despite achieving high grades earlier in my degree and having been told I am intelligent, it can feel hard to believe anything good when sustaining motivation and focus is incredibly difficult. \n\nI would appreciate anyone's tips on being proactive around preventing burnout and how you look after yourself during term!\nHope you have a happy week",

I also find the environment of a mall or grocery store to be super exhausting and I get decision fatigue. I&amp;#39;ve found with ordering online I can just add things to the basket as I remember them or find recipes throughout the week and then submit the order when I&amp;#39;m ready :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Started back at the gym and have made a competition with a friend to attend x many sessions a week &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up my desk space and bought new pens that I love, + ergonomic mouse and keypad so I&amp;#39;m super comfy and look forward to being in that space &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have some money set aside for appointments with my psych so I&amp;#39;m not scrounging for it when I forget I have an appointment and it pops up on my schedule :&amp;#39;)\nI have seen a clinical psychologist for the past 5 months and he came to the conclusion fairly early I have adhd and some associated depression. I have been on a waitlist for the final assessment by the psychiatrist which is coming up very soon and I&amp;#39;m really hoping that regular medication can help me. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my final year and final term of undergrad and kind of the deciding point (grades wise) as to whether a post grad school will take me.\nI&amp;#39;m really trying to stay positive because the truth is after so many cycles of burnout and depression I lost some faith in myself. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to achieve consistency despite achieving high grades earlier in my degree and having been told I am intelligent, it can feel hard to believe anything good when sustaining motivation and focus is incredibly difficult. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate anyone&amp;#39;s tips on being proactive around preventing burnout and how you look after yourself during term!\nHope you have a happy week&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But I believed that I couldn't put them away because I still wanted to make the masks! So that's where the supplies belonged until I gave up on the project or completed it.\n\nToday I was sitting at my messy desk, wishing it were clear, and thought, \"I could put these supplies in the sewing box that exists in this very room for the exact purpose of holding sewing supplies when they are not in use. Then I can just take them out again when I want to use them\"\n\nMIND BLOWN, YOU GUYS! My desk has so much more room now. And -- get this! -- everything I was going to use for the masks is still no more than 5 feet away.\n\nIt literally did not occur to me that I could do that.",

(And overwhelmed by decision fatigue re:which kind of face masks to make)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For three months, all of the supplies have been sitting on my desk, taking up space, but I&amp;#39;ve been too focused (lol, &amp;quot;focused&amp;quot;) on other things to get around to it. But I believed that I couldn&amp;#39;t put them away because I still wanted to make the masks! So that&amp;#39;s where the supplies belonged until I gave up on the project or completed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I was sitting at my messy desk, wishing it were clear, and thought, &amp;quot;I could put these supplies in the sewing box that exists in this very room for the exact purpose of holding sewing supplies when they are not in use. Then I can just take them out again when I want to use them&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MIND BLOWN, YOU GUYS! My desk has so much more room now. And -- get this! -- everything I was going to use for the masks is still no more than 5 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It literally did not occur to me that I could do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Too many options overload my brain and cause decision fatigue.\n\nI struggle with keeping my apartment clean and organized, and I feel this really contributes to my overall stress and disorganization.

Basically, my issue is that I can never get shit done even if I have put time aside to do it ( so not a time management issue... I guess). I am at a performing arts uni in the UK so I'm pretty busy as well as having a part-time job and having to take care of myself (but I am a 25-year-old woman so I can manage that!) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\\`s say I have a list of 10 things that need to be done like write an essay proposal, practice monologue, update my acting CV, wash the dishes, clean my room, call the doctors, upload pics of stuff I want to sell etc etc\n\nI try and prioritise to see what's the most urgent thing to do and is a closest deadline etc but then I get guilty about not doing the other thing or find it distracting to work in a messy room so I start cleaning my room but then I get distracted by something else and eventually I feel so exhausted I end up doing nothing. I just can\\`t focus on one thing at a time as much as I try all the other things that need to be done are there at the back of my head like REmEmBER mE!! and so, in the end, nothing gets done. \n\nI have always had a bad rep for being lazy when actually its all just a big struggle for me. Sorry if this has been asked before and I have heard of people say that time management helped but even if I do a schedule for myself like \\`\\`ill spend an hour on this and another hour on that\\`\\` I don't get anything done! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if its decision fatigue, genuine laziness or just being ADHD/add but I need advice! Any ideas will help!",

Basically, my issue is that I can never get shit done even if I have put time aside to do it ( so not a time management issue... I guess). I am at a performing arts uni in the UK so I&amp;#39;m pretty busy as well as having a part-time job and having to take care of myself (but I am a 25-year-old woman so I can manage that!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let`s say I have a list of 10 things that need to be done like write an essay proposal, practice monologue, update my acting CV, wash the dishes, clean my room, call the doctors, upload pics of stuff I want to sell etc etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try and prioritise to see what&amp;#39;s the most urgent thing to do and is a closest deadline etc but then I get guilty about not doing the other thing or find it distracting to work in a messy room so I start cleaning my room but then I get distracted by something else and eventually I feel so exhausted I end up doing nothing. I just can`t focus on one thing at a time as much as I try all the other things that need to be done are there at the back of my head like REmEmBER mE!! and so, in the end, nothing gets done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always had a bad rep for being lazy when actually its all just a big struggle for me. Sorry if this has been asked before and I have heard of people say that time management helped but even if I do a schedule for myself like ``ill spend an hour on this and another hour on that`` I don&amp;#39;t get anything done! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if its decision fatigue, genuine laziness or just being ADHD/add but I need advice! Any ideas will help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was a war zone and it felt like it too.\n\nMy room was actually making my symptoms worse.\n\nBut in the recent months that I've now been out of school, I've had the time to work on my organizational skills and slowly create a space that I'm comfortable in. I wanted to share my experience over this year and what I've learned that personally worked really well. This post originally was a comment on a post of a fellow redditor asking about how people with ADHD kept their rooms clean. I also figured that since I stayed up until 3 A.M typing this I might as well spread it to the whole community.\n\nOrganization and cleaning my room was something I struggled with for a long time and I'll admit I'm still not perfect at, which keep in mind is okay :).\n\nBut it clicked after my girlfriend and I spent a day moving around my furniture and rearranging my room resulting in my room being in a really clean state and feeling good.\n\nThere were a few factors at play but here are some tips that solidified the tendency to keep my room clean.\n\n**1) Have a reason or ideology that you are fascinated with!**\n\nMy main reason for wanting to even rearrange my room in the first place was how it made me feel. My last year of school was chaotic and I never had time or space to put my school work so when I got home my backpack would explode all over my room...on top of the things that were already there. I realized just being in my room reminded me of how behind I was in school and I was no longer comfortable, productive, or calm in what should be my safe space.\n\nI also felt like I had been pushing off going through my stuff before college and that I had accumulated a bunch of things that could be categorized as: useless and didn't use or need, needed at one point but couldn't find it, unreachable or inconvenient, or frequently used but didn't have a dedicated spot.\n\nAt the time it helped that I had an increasing interest in minimalist and essentialist ideas, interior design and honestly just the overall aesthetic of beautiful decoration with a purpose! I loved the idea that I could put everything hidden away but easily accessible at all times.\n\nAt this point this is where you utilize your hyperfocuses to design a space where you feel comfortable and safe. A space that doesn't exaggerate your symptoms. A space where you feel like... well... you! Once you are then interconnected with your space as an extension of your personality \"tidying\" becomes caring.\n\n**2) Identify your problem spots, break your room into these spots, and focus on the habits associated with the spot.**\n\nThe whole room, especially for us folk, is a very overwhelming project...unless we are sent over the edge in hyperfocus mode once every 3 months where we spend hours restoring the room cleaner than it has ever been before...\n\nBut only to return to its dirty state.\n\nWhat helped me a ton was not to even think about my room as a whole. Instead I noticed the problem spots: parts of my room that are unorganized and prevent me from wanting to put things back where they belong. Not only did they deter me from putting things back but also from dreading searching for things you need when you need them.\n\nMy main problem spot was my dresser/ closet which also included laundry and clothing. It was very difficult for me to organize my laundry, then remember to load it in the washer, then switch them out, then fold them and then put them away all while my dresser had no organization. I wasn't going to do my laundry if my dresser wasn't clean. The problem spot was my dresser/closet the problem habit was my laundry routine (or lack thereof).\n\n**3) Before you start, a few reminders**\n\n*\\~This whole process may take some time\\~*\n\nI started in March and I still have some aspects to work on but between now and then I've completed my dresser drawers (not whats on top), closet, closet shelf, random technology, side drawer full of school supplies (also not the top), desk, and bed. Once you master the design and organization of a problem spot it will forever stay clean. You can do it &lt;3\n\n*\\~Small habits go a long ways\\~*\n\nOnce you clear out and organize a problem spot, focus on the problem habit that let it get dirty in the first place. I do my laundry every week on Sunday and I use the change of loads to give me breaks in between my obsessive interest in random things throughout the day. When a load is done I fold it immediately (only if my carpet is vacuumed so I use it as motivation to vacuum before the first load is done also adding a deadline). Then I put it away in the assigned spots. For laundry days I may also save a favorite podcast I enjoy listening to.\n\n*\\~Forgive and be easy on yourself when you fail\\~*\n\nWe aren't perfect and some days are worse than others. When you are going through a bad patch, the feeling of your systems falling apart can be even more demoralizing. Taking things slow and being aware that you aren't caring for your environment as much can decrease the chance of reverting back to old habits. Personally for me its good to give myself that mental space and be a little lazy during more difficult times (like entering battery saver mode). When I then need to shower or sleep I tidy up one of my problem areas for a few minutes then \"reward\" myself with a shower or sleep. Then not only do I feel physically cleaner or well rested but also more comfortable in my room because my environment is now clean as well.\n\n*\\~Utilize \"coupling\" with your problem habits\\~*\n\nIf you find yourself leaving dishes in your room, use something else you need to go out of your room for and bring your bowl with. A water bottle has worked wonders for me when it comes to dishes in my room. I'll think oh I should refill my bottle and I'll take my dishes with me then come back feeling more comfortable (and hydrated) than I was before. This also prevents me from keeping dishes overnight because I have to have water when I take my meds in the morning anyways so it doesn't hurt to fill it before I sleep.\n\n*\\~And the most importantly...*\n\n**4) UTILIZE HYPER FOCUS MODE!**\n\nIf you suddenly feel the urge or reason to dive deep and organize a problem spot, go for it! This way you don't build resentment towards yourself when you plan on cleaning a problem spot then never get around to it. The design and work of creating a connection with your space should be enjoyable and the feeling of tidiness: addicting.\n\n**5) Consider an effective design of the problem spot**\n\nIn order for a spot to stay organized, the stored items should be placed in a specified unique place that's logical to you and be easily accessible. This part is a little challenging for me sometimes because it involves organizing many items with different variables while having multiple constraints. Too much info takes a lot of energy and can cause decision fatigue.\n\nI recommend taking breaks when you can (maybe to switch out your laundry) and to come prepared with some good content to listen to while you do it. And really don't be afraid to find a stopping point for the day if it becomes taxing and unsatisfying. Then pick it back up whenever you feel.\n\nWhen I'm designing these storage spaces I ask myself questions to make it a little easier to organize. Do I need this object? Does it already have a designated spot? Does it belong in my room? Do I access this item frequently or do I want to store it in a more inaccessible spot? Are there other items similar to it? Is it big enough to be placed on its own or should I put it in a smaller container like a pencil bag or small box with other items? Do I have space here?\n\n**6) Keeping your space clean and tidy**\n\nNow that you've probably spent some time learning new routines and building a connection with your space its time to talk about maintenance.\n\n*\\~Have a dedicated chore day\\~*\n\nOn this day you do bulk chore tasks like vacuuming or laundry if needed. Follow it the best that you can but the point of this isn't only about consistency but having a period of time where you EXPECT to be doing these tasks instead of when you feel like it. You don't have to every week but you probably will since you expect to have the time to do them.\n\n*\\~Diligently practice taking the time to put things back where they belong\\~*\n\nWhen trying on clothes, any you don't where fold really quick and put back. Make sure when you change you place dirty clothes in clothes hamper. Place your keys and wallet in the same place when you come home (also helps in not losing things). When you get out of bed practice making it in the morning (protip if one side is against the wall and you sleep alone tuck the top of that side in tight so when you wake up its 100000x easier to make). When at the store if you pick something up put it exactly how you found it (this is also just very nice of you thank you :)). Just. Practice. Once you get that down you will never go back.\n\n*\\~Decorate with things that bring you joy and show off your personality!\\~*\n\nHouse plants are always cute and easygoing companions :))).\n\n*\\~Finally allow time before doing another \"anchor\" activities to tidy up every day\\~*\n\nAnchors are things that restore you back to comfort like eating, showering, or sleeping. Bedtime is the best time for some quick tidying because its like resetting and ending the day by putting away all the work or objects and tucking away my distractions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe key to creating a tidy, comfortable space is developing a love for the process of decluttering and the space itself. As you isolate and master keeping parts or problem spots of your room, the whole room will come together into one cohesive space that glows with your personality and allows you to feel safe. Take it a month at a time and don't even think about your room but the spots as building blocks to a clean room.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for how long this was. I had no idea the process I used for making my room organized was such a complex project. Writing this out made me realize that my ADHD may make it hard for me to organize lots of categories of information, for me to start large projects due to intimidation, or for me to create consistency in my life. But by redesigning my room, I overcame all of these obstacles. I'm very different from the 8th grader who would never do his homework because I could never keep track of pencils and was too embarrassed to ask my peers.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you! I hope this was all helpful and I wish you so much luck. I hope organizing your room allows you to have a space for you to freely be you without stress and inevitably lead you to an overall more organized lifestyle like it did for me :)\n\n**You can do it!! &lt;3**",

Ik we're on a spectrum and I may be lucky to find these helpful, but behavioral modification is part of any wholesome intervention. This post is intended to offer some strategies that might work for you. I really hope it doesn\u2019t come off preachy &amp; PSA: I misstep w these things all the time, but success isn\u2019t linear yada yada. TLDR at the top bc we all have ADHD.\n\n1. Meditation: The Waking Up app changed my life. Meditate sitting up in a chair in the morning, not lying down before bed. Find a teacher or app (**Waking Up**) that truly teaches you what meditation is and what it should look like: you *do not* need to have a \u201cblank mind.\u201d In fact, pop-up thoughts are vital to proper meditation practice. This is a literal method to train your focus and if decades of data isn\u2019t enough to convince you, I personally promise it works.    \u00a0\n2. Routines &amp; Prepping: [Decision fatigue](https://jamesclear.com/willpower-decision-fatigue) is real and the best way to get past it is to reduce the number of decisions in your life. If you spend a little time early on, you save a big time later. Set routines for everything you do routinely. If it\u2019s a daily task (food, hygiene, bedtime, exercise), you should always know what step comes next.\u00a0\n3. \u201cJust this once\u201d and \u201cNever twice\u201d: If you hear about a strategy that sounds useful but overwhelming, decide to do it *just this once.* See how it feels and move forward accordingly. If you have a physical object, *never put it down twice.* Clothes can go from dryer to bed, but next stop is the dresser-for god\u2019s sake let that chair breathe.\n4. Research- maybe a personal preference for hyperfocus, but I find incredible motivation from learning the science behind strategies and cognition. The brain is amazing, even our impaired little beauties. Attention is quite literally our most valuable resource.\u00a0\n5. Exercise &amp; Eat Well: We all know this one but it should be emphasized. Physical health is crucial to achieving healthy cognition. Feed yo body feed yo brain.\n6. Lists: Lists are good. Cross off feels good. [No forget feels good](https://youtu.be/VvPaEsuz-tY).\n7. Therapy: Not even medication plus meditation can compete with a good therapist. You don\u2019t have to go forever, but go for a bit. The hard part is finding one you like but I promise it\u2019s worth the trial &amp; error.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1- Meditation.\n\n* [Here\u2019s a link to one free month](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/redeemMonth/1821a4) with the Waking Up app so you can test it out yourself. $100/year BUT they don\u2019t want money to be a barrier for anyone so if you email [support@wakingup.com](mailto:support@wakingup.com), they will give you a free subscription. How beautiful is that? Their intro course\u2019s first episode is only 8 minutes long. You can do it.\n* I stan this app because it has more/better content than any other app I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s organized, and it teaches you what meditation is, far beyond just focusing on your breath or doing a body scan. There are podcast-y features with lessons, interviews with brilliant ppl in related fields, and Q&amp;As with the app\u2019s creator and other practiced meditators. They offer different courses on different types of meditation.\u00a0If you already have an app that works for you, that's good! Use it!\n* Since meditating regularly, I am more patient, my emotions are far better regulated, I initiate non-preferred tasks easier and focus on them longer, I am more present during conversations, I am more compassionate when others disappoint me or inconvenience me, I almost never get angry with myself when I get off task or otherwise pull an ADHD move. I\u2019m telling you, *proper* meditation gives you a whole new perspective on what\u2019s going on with your brain.\n\n2- Routines &amp; Prepping\n\n* This whole post idea came from the \u201cAbout Showers\u201d post the other day cuz I just couldn't relate to shower struggles. Here\u2019s the idea: if you do it routinely, you should have a routine for it.\u00a0\n* Task initiation is hard for us. Tasks seem overwhelming, we fear we\u2019ll miss out on X if we do Y, we fear we aren\u2019t being maximally productive. Get rid of the feeling of overwhelm by setting routines and prepping materials. Determine the best order to do things then do things in that order consistently. We thrive on routine. Narrow down what you\u2019ll wear before the week comes (covid is a great time to pare down your wardrobe), eat the same breakfast/lunch/dinner every day, find/create a workout routine (r/bodyweightfitness) and stick to it.\u00a0\n* Feel like you want to be doing something else while you shower? Podcast, baby. I got one of those suction cupped sponge holders for the kitchen sink and put it in the far top corner of the shower so I can put my phone in it.\u00a0\n* Prepping is a gift to a future you. Prep your lunches on Sunday or Monday (r/mealprepsunday). *Keep* things where they will be accessible to you for your individual needs, even if that means your meds/vitamins go in the kitchen because that\u2019s where you fill your morning glass of water. There is always a way to keep things convenient and organized. It may mean you exercise the [ADHD Tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/l4ybvt/when_you_buy_things_pay_the_adhd_tax_upfront/) and spend a little extra on a discreet organizer or new shelf, but it can be done.\n\n3- \u201cJust this once\u201d and \u201cNever twice\u201d\n\n* Just this once: Just try the thing one time. This is somewhat a mantra I will use if I see a tip or trick on r/decidingtobebetter, r/selfimprovement, r/motivation. Just try it once! Just do it and plan to never do it again unless it was helpful. Eases the desire to avoid.\n* Never twice: Unrelated to just this once lol this comes from my dear mother. It\u2019s an organizational hack. I never set something down twice. Mail can go from the mailbox to the counter, but then I open it-it can\u2019t go to my desk or I should\u2019ve put it there in the first place. Apply this to everything: mail, laundry, scissors you took out to open a package, the box for that package that needs to go to recycling, the book inside the package that needs to go on your shelf. Step two is the destination.\u00a0\n\n4- Research\n\n* Oooooo baby if you \u201cproductively procrastinate\u201d like me, this ain\u2019t new to you. Having data for why a deficit exists or why a strategy works is a huge motivator for following through with tasks. Understanding how apps like Instagram have more power over your brain than you, are designed to grip your attention, and literally change human behavior can encourage you to avoid them. Learning about the brain and the psychology of attention also opens you up to understanding what\u2019s going on with you in a way that will help you be more compassionate with yourself. This, in turn, reduces frustration.\u00a0\n* I swear I regularly feel like Charlie Kelly with Pepe Silvia connecting every new thing I learn about behavior and psychology because it\u2019s all intertwined. It\u2019s so rewarding to recognize how things fit together and truly understand how *and why* you can apply this new knowledge to your life.\n* May I direct you to the Waking Up conversation with Adam Gazzaly that focuses on differentiating top-down and bottom-up attention, details our propensity for information foraging, and then describes self-help strategies and the evidence behind them?\n\n5- Exercise &amp; Eat Well\n\n* Ain\u2019t no denying the power of a healthy body. Again, r/mealprepsunday will help you eat healthier with far less effort.\u00a0\n* I recently learned that physical health is a stronger predictor of cognitive functioning during old age than any other factor. That\u2019s just the example that comes to mind. So spend less time on sudokus and crosswords and get on a treadmill. If you can\u2019t run, jog; if you can\u2019t jog, walk. Cardio is vital to heart health, weight lifting is a godsend, bodyweight fitness will give you new dreams, and there are loads of yoga, pilates, dance, HIIT, and cardio workouts available for free on YouTube.\n\n6- Lists\n\n* Short list for things to do today. Long list for things to do this week. Beyond that, I plug things into my phone calendar (use your phone calendar!! and set alerts for important events!!) Physical lists are good because seeing things crossed off will make you feel accomplished which = motivating. That\u2019s all, I dig lists. This is a list. See?\n\n7- Therapy\n\n* Specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which isolates three factors: Thoughts, Behaviors, Emotions. These all affect each other and if you can intervene at the level of thought, you can change your life. Thoughts arising in your awareness are not in your control. You can\u2019t help but picture a knight when you read \u201cpicture a knight.\u201d What you *can* do is stop yourself from ruminating or daydreaming about knights. You can truly end the self-criticism to \u201cstop thinking about knights!!!\u201d The \u2018yelling at yourself strategy\u2019 will never work! It has \u201cknight\u201d in the sentence! This is a skill that takes practice and will be hugely assisted by meditation (another plug for Waking Up), but I promise you can do it.\n* Before my ADHD dx, therapy, &amp; years of trial/error with these kinds of strategies, I felt hopeless. I did not see a way out of the ruminations, anxiety, and bleak visions of the future. All I could do was remind myself of my own failings. I escaped into daydreams to avoid thinking about my actual life, relationships, and challenges. I feel so sorry and so compassionate for my past self and I wish I could share with her what I know now. Intervening on these ruminating thoughts changed things. I learned that you don\u2019t need to \u201cfollow the narrative\u201d when an anxious thought arises. You can feel fire at the back of your neck, recognize that it arose when you realized you forgot today\u2019s deadline, and then just think about that fire until it dies down. You don\u2019t need to berate yourself or wish again and again that things would be different. Here is how you make them different. You get help.",

It may mean you exercise the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/l4ybvt/when_you_buy_things_pay_the_adhd_tax_upfront/\"&gt;ADHD Tax&lt;/a&gt; and spend a little extra on a discreet organizer or new shelf, but it can be done.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- \u201cJust this once\u201d and \u201cNever twice\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just this once: Just try the thing one time. This is somewhat a mantra I will use if I see a tip or trick on &lt;a href=\"/r/decidingtobebetter\"&gt;r/decidingtobebetter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/selfimprovement\"&gt;r/selfimprovement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/motivation\"&gt;r/motivation&lt;/a&gt;. Just try it once! Just do it and plan to never do it again unless it was helpful. Eases the desire to avoid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never twice: Unrelated to just this once lol this comes from my dear mother. It\u2019s an organizational hack. I never set something down twice. Mail can go from the mailbox to the counter, but then I open it-it can\u2019t go to my desk or I should\u2019ve put it there in the first place. Apply this to everything: mail, laundry, scissors you took out to open a package, the box for that package that needs to go to recycling, the book inside the package that needs to go on your shelf. Step two is the destination.\u00a0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4- Research&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Oooooo baby if you \u201cproductively procrastinate\u201d like me, this ain\u2019t new to you. Having data for why a deficit exists or why a strategy works is a huge motivator for following through with tasks. Understanding how apps like Instagram have more power over your brain than you, are designed to grip your attention, and literally change human behavior can encourage you to avoid them. Learning about the brain and the psychology of attention also opens you up to understanding what\u2019s going on with you in a way that will help you be more compassionate with yourself. This, in turn, reduces frustration.\u00a0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I swear I regularly feel like Charlie Kelly with Pepe Silvia connecting every new thing I learn about behavior and psychology because it\u2019s all intertwined. It\u2019s so rewarding to recognize how things fit together and truly understand how &lt;em&gt;and why&lt;/em&gt; you can apply this new knowledge to your life.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;May I direct you to the Waking Up conversation with Adam Gazzaly that focuses on differentiating top-down and bottom-up attention, details our propensity for information foraging, and then describes self-help strategies and the evidence behind them?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5- Exercise &amp;amp; Eat Well&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ain\u2019t no denying the power of a healthy body. Again, &lt;a href=\"/r/mealprepsunday\"&gt;r/mealprepsunday&lt;/a&gt; will help you eat healthier with far less effort.\u00a0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I recently learned that physical health is a stronger predictor of cognitive functioning during old age than any other factor. That\u2019s just the example that comes to mind. So spend less time on sudokus and crosswords and get on a treadmill. If you can\u2019t run, jog; if you can\u2019t jog, walk. Cardio is vital to heart health, weight lifting is a godsend, bodyweight fitness will give you new dreams, and there are loads of yoga, pilates, dance, HIIT, and cardio workouts available for free on YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6- Lists&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Short list for things to do today. Long list for things to do this week. Beyond that, I plug things into my phone calendar (use your phone calendar!! and set alerts for important events!!) Physical lists are good because seeing things crossed off will make you feel accomplished which = motivating. That\u2019s all, I dig lists. This is a list. See?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7- Therapy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which isolates three factors: Thoughts, Behaviors, Emotions. These all affect each other and if you can intervene at the level of thought, you can change your life. Thoughts arising in your awareness are not in your control. You can\u2019t help but picture a knight when you read \u201cpicture a knight.\u201d What you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is stop yourself from ruminating or daydreaming about knights. You can truly end the self-criticism to \u201cstop thinking about knights!!!\u201d The \u2018yelling at yourself strategy\u2019 will never work! It has \u201cknight\u201d in the sentence! This is a skill that takes practice and will be hugely assisted by meditation (another plug for Waking Up), but I promise you can do it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Before my ADHD dx, therapy, &amp;amp; years of trial/error with these kinds of strategies, I felt hopeless. I did not see a way out of the ruminations, anxiety, and bleak visions of the future. All I could do was remind myself of my own failings. I escaped into daydreams to avoid thinking about my actual life, relationships, and challenges. I feel so sorry and so compassionate for my past self and I wish I could share with her what I know now. Intervening on these ruminating thoughts changed things. I learned that you don\u2019t need to \u201cfollow the narrative\u201d when an anxious thought arises. You can feel fire at the back of your neck, recognize that it arose when you realized you forgot today\u2019s deadline, and then just think about that fire until it dies down. You don\u2019t need to berate yourself or wish again and again that things would be different. Here is how you make them different. You get help.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have primarily inattentive ADHD which tends to manifest as sluggishness, lethargy, decision fatigue, and brain fog. My meds are definitely effective with regards to eliminating much of the brain fog and I feel a lot 'sharper'and have more mental stamina with certain tasks. However, it's hard to assess whether I am really on the optimum med/dosage as there are a number of issues I still struggle with enormously. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting started on tasks still feels extremely onerous and daunting although I am aware that this partly stems from anxiety, particularly when tackling large projects like my undergrad dissertation which I am completing over the summer. Task switching still requires concerted effort and I often find myself breaking momentum and procrastinating basic tasks, e.g. taking a shower but then wasting 45 mins on my phone before I get dressed even when medicated. I find that it's easier for me to sustain focus on mundane tasks, like essay writing if I'm just having to sit in one place and focus on one task whereas more 'active' chores like preparing food, grocery shopping, and cleaning still feel very draining because of the multi-tasking involved. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm actually quite embarrassed to write that out and admit that because I feel like I am still very much failing at the basics of life. Idk if it's just the particular nature of my ADHD which causes me to feel fatigued very easily but I've been wondering whether I should ask my psych about switching meds. I'm in the UK so Elvanse (Vyvanse) is an option and I've spoken to many people in my support group who are on it. My psychiatrist on the NHS has been pretty chill as well so I think she'd be open to it but I still have that nagging fear that I'll look like a drug-seeker lol. I'm aware that the meds aren't going to do the heavy lifting for you and that so many factors can reduce the effectiveness of your meds (lack of sleep etc, PMS) but I am curious to see whether I would get any more benefit by switching to an amphetamine-based med versus methylphenidate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else had experience with switching to Vyvanse from Concerta/Ritalin? Those with ADHD-Pi, which meds have you found most helpful?",

Idk if it&amp;#39;s just the particular nature of my ADHD which causes me to feel fatigued very easily but I&amp;#39;ve been wondering whether I should ask my psych about switching meds. I&amp;#39;m in the UK so Elvanse (Vyvanse) is an option and I&amp;#39;ve spoken to many people in my support group who are on it. My psychiatrist on the NHS has been pretty chill as well so I think she&amp;#39;d be open to it but I still have that nagging fear that I&amp;#39;ll look like a drug-seeker lol. I&amp;#39;m aware that the meds aren&amp;#39;t going to do the heavy lifting for you and that so many factors can reduce the effectiveness of your meds (lack of sleep etc, PMS) but I am curious to see whether I would get any more benefit by switching to an amphetamine-based med versus methylphenidate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had experience with switching to Vyvanse from Concerta/Ritalin? Those with ADHD-Pi, which meds have you found most helpful?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019m already identifying a lot of things I don\u2019t do because of my ADD is linked to low energy and negative emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I know it\u2019s really hard to pack my wardrobe because it\u2019s the whole day and it would be messy in a week. The existing energy would be further drained by the negative emotions tagged to it. \u201cI have to go through step 1 to 10 and it\u2019s honestly TIRING.\u201d And then I continue to have a messy wardrobe. Cos I fear the feeling of being so drained that comes after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone feels this way? I\u2019m not medicated so I\u2019m trying to find strategies that could work so I CAN FINISH THINGS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I\u2019d like to add that thinking systematically is really hard for me! It\u2019s like being pulled into 10 places and all 10 needs my attention now. I\u2019m keep getting decision fatigue despite the fact that there are only 3 things on my to-do list. It\u2019s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My husband will be able to largely work from home and I have a very flexible schedule as a nurse.  \n\nBit of background - I'm 36, was just diagnosed with Inattentive ADD a couple years ago.  I'm so grateful to my PCP that sent me to testing as we were largely focused on my depression that had been getting worse and worse with motherhood and nothing was working.  She noted that my biggest struggle seemed to be fatigue and depression from overstimulation and recognized that it may be a symptom of ADD.  I had otherwise largely been able to deal with this through school and being a nurse, and this was validated with testing in that I have a very high IQ.  Parenthood is what sent me over the edge!  I had found with a combination of medication and scheduled alone time every week.  I could manage!  Life was good!  But then COVID... \n\nNow that I know this is going to be the norm for awhile without an end in site, I need to get organized.  I need a plan and structure for every day, so there are not 500 requests from the children and husband every day of \"What are we doing?  Can we do \\_\\_\\_?  What's for dinner?  How long are you going to be doing that?  Will you do this with me?  Can I have \\_\\_\\_\\_?  Etc, etc, you get the idea\" Until I can't take it anymore, and shut down by either disappearing for 2 hours and getting nothing done, and my husband getting upset for an unanticipated solo parenting time, and then everyone is upset when I return.  Or I drink a lot.  Or I'm just a miserable person to be around.  \n\nI need my kids, husband, and myself to know what's going to be happening every day, and when is mom going to have her much-needed alone time so her brain can function and she can be herself.  Less decision fatigue and over-stimulation.  My schedule varies every week.  Its usually 1-2 12 hr shifts a week, and nothing else is done by me those days except work.  \n\nDoes anyone have a successful system?  Should I buy one of the big family calendars on Amazon to put on the fridge?  And what's the best personal planner?  I've done a BuJo.  It worked great, but I spent COUNTLESS hours overdoing it.  And then so much time searching for the right colored pen so I could continue the system I had made!  Ha!  I'd rather have something already made.  \n\nThank you in advance!  \n\nTL;DR  - ADD Mom needs help getting life/family/brain organized.  Need planner/family calendar suggestions.",

I've tried the pomadoro method of using a timer and to do list games like habitica with limited success but also i wasnt properly diagnosed yet with adhd as well as when i was only on a pediatric dose of my vyvanse. \n\nSo, I decided that I want to budget my mental energy and focus towards what matters to me rather than alot of physical \"noise\" around me.\n\nIronically, the pandemic has really helped me by cutting down on the amount of distractions since i work from home. also had several weeks of unlimited overtime since i was doing customer service when all shit hit the fan on getting items from A to B during june. So, i had a modest money windfall i was able to finally pay off some of my debt in collections and was just confused on what i should do with the remaining amount... and for once i decided i should just do nothing with it... let it sit there.... prevent any worries about NSF charges, avoid checking my balance so i don't get tempted, keep my bills on auto draft so i don't have to think about it. also, i get terrible decision fatigue from shopping online because its so subjective with so many to choose from/compare unless i know for sure its of immediate importance. while in person, i can't control myself. So, honestly, i had no idea that just buying less was the laziest way of getting organized lol. I don't have to clean or think about what i don't buy. also, i do plan on moving in the near future so i've been trying to find about 3 items a day i can get rid of. i now focus on \"shopping\" my house aka look for what i can use and repair since what i already own is more valuable to me than anything i would buy. Also, i finally got brave enough to pull the trigger on taking an actual adult dose of 30 mg, which i know is tiny for many, but the side effects made me hesitate; now they are doing ok since i make sure to take my blood pressure meds and beta blockers\n\nSo, anyway, i've heard of the concept of time budgetting/ time mapping. How it works is you set a stop watch and see how long it takes for you to complete a task. I was completely shocked that it only took me 8 minutes to throw away all my trash! there was little to no rotten food  that was sitting out because i can remember well enough to put my groceries away as well as see what food i have in the fridge, there was less mail laying around since I had fewer collections mailers, there was less packaging because i didnt have to overbuy/replace what i lost or broke, i have fewer used tissues to throw away because the air quality is better and even need practically no antihistamines and asthma meds these days! \n\nI'm still far off from my space from looking pretty but everything in my space is able to be used as intended. i can safely walk through all door ways without being impacted, my clothes are in the closet and dresser. its just awesome what can happen when my focus switches away from objects to experiences with baby steps along the way",

I was completely shocked that it only took me 8 minutes to throw away all my trash! there was little to no rotten food  that was sitting out because i can remember well enough to put my groceries away as well as see what food i have in the fridge, there was less mail laying around since I had fewer collections mailers, there was less packaging because i didnt have to overbuy/replace what i lost or broke, i have fewer used tissues to throw away because the air quality is better and even need practically no antihistamines and asthma meds these days! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still far off from my space from looking pretty but everything in my space is able to be used as intended. i can safely walk through all door ways without being impacted, my clothes are in the closet and dresser. its just awesome what can happen when my focus switches away from objects to experiences with baby steps along the way&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
