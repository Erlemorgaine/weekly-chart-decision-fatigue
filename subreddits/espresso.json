Trying to get the best bang for my buck obviously. I'm fine spending 300-500 max. Currently own a 1Zpresso JX but i know it won't cut it for espresso and also I can't be arsed to grind that finely manually.\n\n\nI've set my mind on one of those two options :\n\n1 : Get a DF64 gen 1 (2nd hand), and upgrade with SSP unimodal / MP burrs. \n\nBudget : 300-400\u20ac (depending on haggling)\n\nPros : DF64 good i guess, good deal\n\nCons : can't grind too coarse, but i think that may not be an issue with SSP burrs as V60 wants somewhat fine grind anyways.\n\n2 : Get a brand new baratza vario W+ (with the steel burrs)\nIt's hard to find 2nd hand for those in France unfortunately so i would have to go for new. (less bang for my buck imo)\n\nPros : Good for both espresso / brew from what i read, no need to mod, reliable brand (i fear DF64 might die on me in the long run)\n\nCons: Have to buy new, is it *actually* good enough for both espresso and brew?, no upgrade path (for burrs)\n\nThe reason I'm set for these two is:\n\n* Currently a brew enjoyer (V60, aeropress) and I'm looking to *also* upgrade my experience with brewing (from my current 1Zpresso JX)\n* availability of 2nd hand DF64 makes for a bargain\n* Those burrs i've selected for DF64 might be surprising but I'm not looking for \"traditional\" espresso feel, chocolatey notes are not my favorite, i'd much rather bring out acidity and clarity. Of course this is all purely theoritical from reading countless reddit threads..\n\n3rd unspoken option is buying a cheap mazzer super jolly / major / any santos grinder, there's literally dozens for sale, and upgrade with SSP burrs but 83mm ssp cost an arm and the wife acceptance factor is very low on these, being built like tanks and all.\n\nFinal thing i sadly cba to wait for a 2 month preorder on some of the newer FOMO grinders...\n\nIf anyone can help me decide (or make me even more indecisive, might happen too !) I'd appreciate it greatly !\n\nFinal thing there's a seller with both a DF64 gen 1 (modded with anti popcorning and distribution thing) and DF64p so I'm not sure which one of those is better",

I received my DF54 a couple of weeks ago, and I've been having some issues with it.\n\nRight off the bat, the first grind ended up jamming the burrs. It was a 19g dose of medium roast beans that I got from a local roaster, and I was grinding on level 13 which seemed to be a good starting point (based on a bit of searching some threads on Reddit). \nMy 1zpresso J Max S handles the same beans just fine.\n\nFor the bit of coffee that did dispense, I noticed it was a lot [coarser](https://ibb.co/xHzDLry) than what I would get from my manual grinder. I cleaned it up, and it didn't jam for the next couple of days, but the coffee was pretty coarse for the recommended ranges for espresso. That's when I considered that maybe the 0 point was off.\n\nI did the [\"chirp\" test](https://streamable.com/dyt20m) and confirmed that my 0 point is off by [at least 10 points](https://ibb.co/xzVW3BJ) which explains why the coffee was so coarse. This was the 2nd issue I faced.\n\nAlso, I noticed that I was seeing a lot of chaff around the [chute](https://ibb.co/cvk9hvr), which shouldn't be happening because of the ionizer. I tried cleaning it with a small brush, but that didn't help much, which leads me to believe that I've got a faulty ionizer. This was the 3rd issue.\n\nI did reach out to MiiCoffee and after talking to a service rep about these issues, he concluded that my burrs weren't properly aligned out of the factory. He suggested that fixing the first two issues requires realigning the burrs and a heat gun to change the 0 point (which is a stupid design choice IMO). They sent me a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYg4TzuyLNE&amp;t) outlining the process. I did try to follow through the video but I just found it to be a bit tedious and I didn't have the stomach to mess with something this expensive and potentially ruin it.\n\nAt this point, I asked them if I could return it, and they gave me the option to waive the return shipping if I bought another grinder from them, which was nice of them.\n\nI guess my questions revolve around the area of what would you do if you were in this situation.\n\nHave any of you been using the DF54? What's your experience like? \nShould I just replace the grinder with another DF54?\n\nHow common are these issues?\n\nDo these grinders need to be recalibrated regularly?\n\nShould I cough up more cash and buy something more expensive and better?\nIf yes, then which ones would you recommend?\n\nI'm seeing so many out there (Timemore 064S, Lagom Mini, Niche Zero, Varia VS3 Gen 2, or other grinders from Turin like the DF64 Gen2 or the 64V) that I'm having decision fatigue. Someone even suggested getting a Ceado e6p saying that they don't have such issues, which may be true, but it is way out of my budget. Do I need to spend that much to not have these issues?\n\nI do want to mention that I want an electronic grinder because it's a chore to enjoy coffee with friends when I have them over. I probably should've foreseen this happening before I got the manual grinder. I do enjoy having coffee with them and I have limited counter space which is the main reason why I chose the DF54 in the first place, but I'm confused now. I even considered buying a drill for my 1zpresso grinder to make things easier because I read that somewhere on here but I don't know if that's a good solution either.\n\nPlease let me know what your thoughts are. Thank you!",
