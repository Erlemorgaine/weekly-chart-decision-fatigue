Cut to today, my first day of a two week break between \u201csemesters\u201d and I wanted to use the time to get some long overdue sewing in. I spent some time yesterday going through my fabric stash and decided on a nice tan twill that I\u2019ve had for a while.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve chosen the right skirt or if I\u2019d like a different one better or if I\u2019d get more wear out of a pair of pants, or if I should just pick a different fabric to work with, or if I should tackle a project from my alteration pile. I\u2019m just so overwhelmed with all the choices that I\u2019m paralyzed into not doing anything at all. \nDon\u2019t really have a point to all of this.
