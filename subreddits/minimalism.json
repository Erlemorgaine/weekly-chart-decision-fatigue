My goal is to save money and increase productivity so I have more time/money for things that add to my life, so not necessarily cutting down but redirecting my priorities. \n\nI feel like material-wise, I've found a good balance. I've been doing a lot of decluttering and found that keeping one good thing for one purpose has been such a game changer and I feel so relieved. I was always a hoarder who liked the idea of options, but I always wanted to save my precious belongings and ended up wasting everything, but at the same time always wanting new (eg. skincare products). I realized that hoarding is what weighed me down from getting newer and better. Of course I am not giving up my closet, but I've become extra conscious about what I decide to spend on. I've started disliking gifts because I don't really want extra items in my house anymore haha.\n\nNow it's my routine that I feel like are cluttered in my brain. I don't know if it's maybe just because I'm in a transition phase in my life, but I feel like my living space always becomes a mess until my weekly clean, and I hate the build up. I feel like there are small daily things that I should do to be proactive that but it's so exhausting sometimes. My daily schedule is also not super consistent with work, so I feel like I'm having a hard time adapting to a routine that feels productive and cannot maintain good habits, especially on my days off. Same with messages/emails; I always procrastinate reading and responding because it all feels so mentally heavy. I was always on top of things in school so maybe I'm just burnt out after 8 years of university?\n\nIs there anything you do for a productive routine in terms of reducing decision fatigue? ",

[Here I've talked about how I go through dopamine detox konmari style](https://stoichuman.com/dopamine-detox-konmari-style/). Eventually, I became more aware of my usage of everything whether it was my wardrobe, my gadgets, apps, or skin-hair care products. I was surprised that it was actually reducing my stress. Take a moment to just imagine your daily routine; what are the few things that you think about every day which aren't really benefiting you in any way but you've to make decisions about, every day. Deciding what clothes to wear, and selecting and stressing about all the clothes that you own isn't helping you in anything, maybe IF you're good at styling then a fake elevation in public perception is what you're getting. I used \"fake\" because if other aspects of your life are in a mess and people think highly of you, well, then it is a fake perception. Anyway, even taking care of your car, watering all the dozens of plants that you have or otherwise, they would die, can be extremely stressful collectively. Individually, they might seem like a small decision that you've to make every day but little by little that is causing you to have decision fatigue about which I'll talk about in a blog post later. But eliminating all of that stressful decision making feels liberating and immensely reduces the stress throughout the day.\n\n\"So, if it is so helpful at reducing your stress, then how can it be toxic for your mind?\", you might be wondering.\n\n## How can Minimalism become toxic for your mind?\n\nWell, humans were hunter gatherers and being able to find fruit used to make our ancestors as happy as you would get if you end up finding latest iPhone lying on the street. Well, I shouldn't talk about iPhone while talking about minimalism. Haha! But why was that fruit such a source of happiness? Survival. Sugar is rich in carbohydrates which is a huge energy store. Today, we do get happy when we have a cake but these sugary food products of modern day are overloaded with sugar which don't need in such high dosage and what are they? Let me answer, \"Toxic for you\". Excess of anything is toxic.\n\nWhile talking about minimalism, everyone talks about reducing items that you own because they add stress in your life but very few people even mention that after few days or a couple of weeks you need to stop thinking about it a lot because that is adding stress too. After 8 days, 8 weeks or 8 months of consuming content related to Minimalism , if you're still constantly consuming it then you're having insecurities about \"your minimalism\".

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started following minimalism in late 2017. I went all in and soon enough it became an essential part of my method of doing a detox. &lt;a href=\"https://stoichuman.com/dopamine-detox-konmari-style/\"&gt;Here I&amp;#39;ve talked about how I go through dopamine detox konmari style&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, I became more aware of my usage of everything whether it was my wardrobe, my gadgets, apps, or skin-hair care products. I was surprised that it was actually reducing my stress. Take a moment to just imagine your daily routine; what are the few things that you think about every day which aren&amp;#39;t really benefiting you in any way but you&amp;#39;ve to make decisions about, every day. Deciding what clothes to wear, and selecting and stressing about all the clothes that you own isn&amp;#39;t helping you in anything, maybe IF you&amp;#39;re good at styling then a fake elevation in public perception is what you&amp;#39;re getting. I used &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; because if other aspects of your life are in a mess and people think highly of you, well, then it is a fake perception. Anyway, even taking care of your car, watering all the dozens of plants that you have or otherwise, they would die, can be extremely stressful collectively. Individually, they might seem like a small decision that you&amp;#39;ve to make every day but little by little that is causing you to have decision fatigue about which I&amp;#39;ll talk about in a blog post later. But eliminating all of that stressful decision making feels liberating and immensely reduces the stress throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, if it is so helpful at reducing your stress, then how can it be toxic for your mind?&amp;quot;, you might be wondering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How can Minimalism become toxic for your mind?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, humans were hunter gatherers and being able to find fruit used to make our ancestors as happy as you would get if you end up finding latest iPhone lying on the street. Well, I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk about iPhone while talking about minimalism. Haha! But why was that fruit such a source of happiness? Survival. Sugar is rich in carbohydrates which is a huge energy store. Today, we do get happy when we have a cake but these sugary food products of modern day are overloaded with sugar which don&amp;#39;t need in such high dosage and what are they? Let me answer, &amp;quot;Toxic for you&amp;quot;. Excess of anything is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While talking about minimalism, everyone talks about reducing items that you own because they add stress in your life but very few people even mention that after few days or a couple of weeks you need to stop thinking about it a lot because that is adding stress too. After 8 days, 8 weeks or 8 months of consuming content related to Minimalism , if you&amp;#39;re still constantly consuming it then you&amp;#39;re having insecurities about &amp;quot;your minimalism&amp;quot;. Stop looking for another &amp;quot;One Tip&amp;quot; about how to be a more minimalist person or worrying about &amp;quot;Am I doing minimalism correctly?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess.

I particularly recognise this with clothing as my body type makes it challenging to find clothes that fit well and are gender affirming. \n\nFor example; last week I found a pair of pants that fit, look good, don't cause any body dysmorphia and \\[bonus\\] don't need tailoring! My first thought was to search online for another pair, as I bought them second hand and the brand no longer makes this specific line of pants. Cue; panic.\n\nIt's distressing to me because it goes against what I believe in as a minimalist and is counterintuitive considering I live in a micro-apartment with very limited storage space beyond the essentials. Logically, I know there will always be something, somewhere, that will sufficiently replace whatever I am obsessing over but that knowledge doesn't turn the panic/scarcity mindset off and the endless googling begins until I have a replacement.\n\nI want to add that for me this goes beyond clothing. For example; if I have a jar of peanut butter open and in-use, I feel the need to have a back-up in the cupboard.

It all started really when I went to college, I was around people more and in a new place and wanted to \u201cdocument\u201d what was happening around me \u2014 and my new friends. But it was still under control, due to limited storage on my phone, I\u2019d have to go through it all periodically. \n\nBut it really exploded into a problem when I went abroad for the first time. I was gone for 5-6 months, and every single day, I was seeing stuff I might never get to see again in my life. I would take multiple photos of the same thing, move on and never go back to select the best one. \n\nThen I\u2019d always feel guilty about how many photos I had and that they were taking up so much space. I struggled with storing it all until I finally gave in and have been paying $3 a month for 50 GB for a while now. And with the pressure off, I didn\u2019t have a burning need to really cull my photos down. Two years later, and I was at 14,000 photos. A completely unreasonable number for me to have, when I knew they weren\u2019t all high quality. \n\nAlong with blurry selfies and low quality content, I fancy myself an amateur photographer and take close up photos of weird random objects, that I later don\u2019t really get around to posting somewhere. \n\nI\u2019m finally getting this under control, though. This app I downloaded (paid another $3 bucks for it...) has helped me delete over 4,000 photos in just over three weeks. I\u2019ve still got a ways to go, and the app\u2019s usefulness will run out soon (it pinpoints similar photos and selects what it thinks is the best one to help with decision fatigue). \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m not sure where to go from here, and how to decide what photos to keep and what to delete. Or even what a more reasonable amount of photos is. Has anyone else struggled with this and have any advice to offer? ",

How do I even start going through my clothes if I don't know what my style is and what I want it to be? Is it okay if I only wear these shoes/dress/shirt once every few months?

Reading this subreddit day and night, watching and listening to minimalists especially Matt D'Avella and The minimalists. Eventually, I realized that minimalism is subjective and now I do have a limited wardrobe which helps me with decision fatigue and I'm very intentional with every aspect of life. Using minimalism techniques(90 days) I started being intentional about every aspect whether its diet, workout, work, or something like dopamine detox.[Here I've talked about how I go through dopamine detox konmari style](https://stoichuman.com/dopamine-detox-konmari-style/).\n\nI'm not very active in this subreddit anymore neither as a reader nor as a poster but this subreddit has helped me lot to shape my life in last few years. These days I have a great job, I'm learning to play guitar, working out 6 days a week, have a great social life(definitely not during lockdown, Haha), and journaling every day and that's all because now I'm being intentional about everything and every activity. Now, I don't have to think intentionally about minimalism or whatever, it's all in the subconscious mind.\n\nI see a lot of posts with redundant questions about \"Is this ok?\", \"I'm not a true minimalist?\" or asking people of this subreddit about how's their wardrobe like. You don't need confirmation from anyone because there is nothing standardized about minimalism.\n\nMinimalism is SIMPLE but it isn't as simple as \"whatever you think is important to you or brings you joy keep that\" because as a newbie to minimalism one doesn't have a perspective and we all think that everything that I currently have is important. Anyway, here's how to do it.\n\n1. Pack all of your stuff as the Minimalists suggest.\n2. Every day take out only the stuff that you need ( not want ) and do this for 90 days.\n3. After 90 days you'll have the real perspective about all the things that are still in the boxes. IF after 90 days you still WANT something out of those boxes then keep it because even after 90 days of \"detox\" you still want something then it must surely be bringing joy to you and it isn't something that you want because you're habitual about it(which you are in the beginning, so 90 days are important).\n\nThat's it. You don't NEED to ask anyone in real life or in this subreddit whether I should keep my blue socks because I already have grey socks. Only you care. Their opinion doesn't matter. And especially stop comparing your minimalism to others' minimalism. They are not comparable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It seems that there are people who seem to fall in to either one camp or the other, so I decided to explore this a bit. Enjoy!\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMinimalism has gained a lot of traction over the years. This isn\u2019t surprising considering how fast-paced and consumeristic our modern lives have become. Minimalism has reached almost buzzword level status, with its popularity being perpetuated amongst YouTubers, bloggers and Instagrammers whether it\u2019s a tour of an apartment with white walls, white furniture and a canvas print that says \u2018live, laugh, love\u2019 or a top down photograph of someone\u2019s neatly arranged outfit for the day. Whilst these trends can be eye-roll inducing at times, they are more often than not oddly satisfying and visually pleasing. What is it about the minimalist aesthetic that draws us in so much, and how is it different from actually \u2013 you know \u2013 being a minimalist?\n\n \n\nMinimalism? What\u2019s that?\n\nMinimalism was originally an art movement that began in post\u2013World War II in the 1960s and early 1970s. It has since spread to several artistic disciplines and fields such as architecture, literature and music. Prominent artists associated minimalism include Philip Glass (the man responsible for the haunting soundtrack of Koyaanisqatsi)\n\nand Yves Klein, who you may know as the guy responsible for an art piece that is literally just a shade of blue on a large canvas (no, seriously \u2013 have a look).\n\nAside from music and modern art, another domain that minimalism applies to is fashion and design, which is what our team at Horizon Ave. is focused on. However, all of this pertains to the view of minimalism as an aesthetic and says nothing of the ideology or principles behind the actual lifestyle and practice.\n\n \n\nThe Meaning of Minimalism\n\nMinimalism as a lifestyle and philosophy is a complex topic and will likely mean slightly different things for different people. But what it boils down to in the end is living only with what you need and value and eliminating the things that draw you away from that. It is in essence about living your life with great intention and saying no to anything frivolous.\n\nThis definition of minimalism can have a wide application, and that all depends on you. It could mean choosing what information you take in, decluttering your wardrobe, having one or two friends instead of many acquaintances, eliminating social media, or as extreme as wearing the same shirt every single day of your life (and washing it every now and again I hope).\n\nWhatever minimalism means to you, the majority of people who identify as one report feeling calmer, less mentally fatigued and an overall greater sense of wellbeing. While it seems ridiculous that a lifestyle in which you only choose to wear white and black outfits can yield such results, it turns out that there are very concrete reasons for this.\n\n \n\nMinimalism As A Lifestyle\n\nMinimalists are all about keeping only what they need and eliminating anything that is unnecessary. Outside of the essentials \u2013 anything that does not have a specific purpose in your life is deemed as a huge distraction to emotional fulfilment because it takes up vital brainpower that could be spent actually living.\n\nScientists and researchers have found out that the more choice we have access to, the more unhappy we are and the more we feel overloaded and want to avoid making a decision altogether. There\u2019s a name for it \u2013 decision fatigue,  and it\u2019s ruining your life. \n\nEvery time you have to make a decision, it saps a little bit of your mental energy. Imagine making decision after decision and you can see how this can quickly accumulate and dampen your mood. We make decisions all the time. Something as simple as choosing what tie to wear or what to have for breakfast drains our mental energy, now think about all the small decisions you make every single day. \n\nA 2011 Columbia University study found that judges were more likely to give prisoners a favourable ruling at the beginning of the day when they were fresh and ready, and after lunch when their energy levels had been somewhat restored. We are only human, and once our mental resources start to dip, we look for the easy way out. \n\nThat\u2019s where minimalism comes in \u2013 if you simplify your life through processes like decluttering, you will eventually reach a point where you are making a very small number of decisions on a daily basis, which will not only result in a clean looking wardrobe or apartment, but a clear, happy, fulfilled state of mind.\n\n \n\nMinimalism As An Aesthetic\n\nThe visual appeal of minimalism as an aesthetic is undeniable, the simple colour schemes, cleanliness and prominent straight lines you see in those Instagram posts create for us a temporary sense of order in our otherwise chaotic worlds. There is something so satisfying when seeing things that reflect simplicity, that paintings that are literally just a blue canvas are considered an innovation in modern art (clearly I can\u2019t get over this). \n\nWhen it comes to minimalist fashion and d\u00e9cor \u2013 this can often be entirely separate from the minimalist lifestyle, and people often confuse the two. You can enjoy wearing wispy tops in various shades of grey and working on a desk that only has 2 items on it and not be a minimalist - because you spent a lot of money acquiring those items and have a large wardrobe for example. Just as well, you can have a studio apartment where your walls are pink and your bright red sofa serves as your bed, desk and kitchen table and be a hardcore minimalist (please no one actually do that).\n\nMinimalism as aesthetic is in theory separate from minimalism as a lifestyle, but in reality there is considerable overlap and that is completely ok.\n\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, the monochromatic colour palettes and simple designs that are becoming popular in fashion and interior design is as much about making a statement about what your worldview is, as it is about looking good. In these areas, quality is much more emphasised over quantity, and that is much closer to the essence of minimalism than people who criticise those only interested in the aesthetic side would have you believe.\n\n \n\nWhich Is Better?\n\nThis is a tough one to answer but the answer is really very simple \u2013 it doesn\u2019t actually matter \u2013 and I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nAt first glance it seems that minimalism as a lifestyle is much better, those people have after all figured out that less is indeed more and us expensive-item hoarding posers could not possibly understand their newfound wisdom with our puny lower consciousness. It makes sense, if you are going to embrace minimalism, why would you buy more stuff? It seems to defeat the purpose.  \n\nHowever, this is ultimately false and one-dimensional. The aesthetic minimalist will scoff at the lifestyle minimalist, saying that it is just thinly veiled asceticism, denying yourself any kind of enjoyment of life in the name of holier-than-thou self righteousness. \n\nThe unsatisfying answer is of course that neither one is better and it\u2019s a little bit of both. There are many different types of people who take to minimalism \u2013 you have those that have found the mental clarity that having less brings and live life this way as a mindfulness exercise. You have those that want to reduce their impact on the world and are anti-consumerist, who fit their entire lives into a backpack and buy one of everything as long as it lasts several years. You have those are all about the optics and love to accumulate simple objects, decoration and clothes that reflect what minimalism means to them, reinforce how they see the world and bring a sense of order to their lives. You also have those that love to discover just how much they can live without.\n\nWhichever type of minimalist category you fall into, there is an overlap of lifestyle and aesthetics. The more you focus on one, the more it will re-inforce the other. You create an apartment that is all white, you will become more of a minimalist in mindset naturally. If you live out of your suitcase \u2013 it goes without saying that your aesthetic choices will lean towards blacks, greys and the most simple functioning objects.\n\nSo whether you want to get rid of 95% of everything you own or rock a new watch that has no dials on it \u2013 go for it! It doesn\u2019t make you any less of a minimalist.\n\ntl;dr - Minimalism is what you make it.\n\nhttps://www.horizonave.net/blogs/news/minimalism-as-a-lifestyle-vs-an-aesthetic-style",
