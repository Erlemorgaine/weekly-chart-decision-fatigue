I got engaged this past November and went through all the emotions of initial wedding planning, but I realized I wasn't willing to go into debt for one day and we didn't want to depend on our parents helping. I already have decision fatigue and would love insight on how others have done this without breaking the bank. We plan on paying as we go and haven't set a hard budget but basically are trying to spend as little as possible.\n\nWe recently got approved for a permit to get married in Yosemite National Park in the first week of June next summer (2025). I am looking at how to make the day special without breaking the bank and would love insight on how others have cut costs? We are inviting 50 but know we are likely going to have 30-40. We are from different parts of the country so this seemed fair to have all of the family/friends have to travel. I will not be having a wedding party. Any tips from anyone who has also had a wedding in the national park?\n\nWhere would you cut costs. What DIY things have worked for you? What did you actually remember and love? This is destination for us as well (though we plan on driving so can bring some things).\n\n***Here is what I have so far...***\n\n* Ceremony site : received a permit for $150\n* Reception site: doing a backyard dinner and was able to rent a cabin for 4 days and it included table/chair/linen rental for up to 40 people for $2500\n* Photographer: my best friend who is giving me 50% off her services (she is super talented but doesn't do it full time) I haven't chosen a package yet but I am guessing it will be about $800-1000\n* Save the dates: got them on sale through Dazzle for about $70\n\n***So what we need to get...***\n\n* Food (I am still in talks with caterers, options are limited) but hoping to get someone for about $50 a person or less (lets say about $2000)\n* Hair/Makeup - I have only received quotes for $1,000+ and I feel like I could do a decent job if I practice for the next 10 months, likely will DIY this (would love to hear other people's experience)\n* Flowers/Decor: I have looked into Something Borrowed for silk flowers. I will likely buy my bouquet and potentially rent one centerpiece per table but not sure yet. It depends on how difficult it would be to bring all of this. At minimum I will have a bouquet for myself and something small to place on the tables (maybe a table runner)\n* Videographer: This is really important to me, and my parents are willing to gift this to us as they want to help pay for a part of the wedding and I know this isn't necessarily within budget\n* Dress: I haven't gone shopping yet, but I am looking to spend less than $1000, ideally less than $500.\n* Husband's outfit: He likely wants to wear jeans, so i will likely just have him get new jeans/cowboy boots and a nice shirt, whatever he is comfortable in so lets say $500 or less\n* DJ: I will just bring a speaker and play background music. This is more of a backyard intimate dinner so I don't plan on having a dance floor\n* Invites: I will likely get them on sale during black Friday and/or DIY them on Canva. I didn't for save the dates due to not finding something I really liked and getting what I thought was a decent price on Zazzle.\n* Plates/Cups: Likely going to get nicer disposable due to it being a national park destination wedding. I have seen some nice ones on Amazon.\n\nHas anyone else gotten married in a National Park that can share their experiences? Our immediate families, best friends, and a few aunts and uncles are excited to make a vacation of it, so I do think we will likely have at least 30 people attending. How would you recommend cutting costs? I appreciate the insight!",

Since I have been planning for a wedding that is 6 months away on a popular date, it was very difficult to find catering. We found one that provides what I would call comfort food, but were unable to taste anything before booking. Here are some items that I am interested in, but not sure of the best combination or if we should do it all! (Decision fatigue talking). Here are the options (also possible to request other items):\n\n* Fruit kabobs\n* Meatballs\n* Chicken (fried or baked)\n* corned beef\n* lasagna\n* home fries\n* waffles\n* Salad\n* Mac and cheese\n* Green beans\n* collard greens\n* chicken salad on brioche (corned beef can be done too)\n\nFor background info: inviting 20ish guests to outside wedding on a farm. Laidback wedding with lawn games during the reception. We want everyone to have an option they like and have happy, full bellies by the end. To my knowledge, we don't have any dietary restrictions. Also, dessert is from somewhere else.\n\nEdit: added greens at the end\n\nEdit 2: added chicken salad bit. Not sure how it would fit, but **also wondering what can be served as appetizer even if not on list.**",

Since I have been planning for a wedding that is 6 months away on a popular date, it was very difficult to find catering. We found one that provides what I would call comfort food, but were unable to taste anything before booking. Here are some items that I am interested in, but not sure of the best combination or if we should do it all! (Decision fatigue talking). Here are the options (also possible to request other items):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fruit kabobs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meatballs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Chicken (fried or baked)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;corned beef&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;lasagna&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;home fries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;waffles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Salad&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mac and cheese&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Green beans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;collard greens&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;chicken salad on brioche (corned beef can be done too)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For background info: inviting 20ish guests to outside wedding on a farm. Laidback wedding with lawn games during the reception. We want everyone to have an option they like and have happy, full bellies by the end. To my knowledge, we don&amp;#39;t have any dietary restrictions. Also, dessert is from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: added greens at the end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: added chicken salad bit. Not sure how it would fit, but &lt;strong&gt;also wondering what can be served as appetizer even if not on list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
