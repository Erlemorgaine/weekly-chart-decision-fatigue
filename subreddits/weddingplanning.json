Our wedding is in 24 days (yay) but i am so over making choices....\n\nFHs Best Man and my MOH are trying to plan an after party (be it in the hotel in a room with BYOB or at a local bar that is open until 2 (the wedding reception ends at midnight).  So they are asking me questions thinking id want to have a say in which route they go... Literally I was just like if you wanna do something great ill make an appearance at the very least, but just plan it because i cannot plan another single thing because i am exhausted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen yesterday, FH tells me that FMIL wants a clear cover for the quilt she made us: some quilt back story: FMIL decides we are having a  chuppah for our secular wedding - we never told her we wanted this.  She then makes us a KING SIZE quilt to use for the chuppah.  FH says thank you we love it (we don't) but that we are not having a chuppah and we already made an arch that we love. There is crying there is not speaking to us, there is all sorts of stuff that i wont get into. So i come up with a plan to use the quilt as a table cloth for our wine ceremony, teh table will be out the entire ceremony but off to the side.  That table will then be used for the guest book after the ceremony so that it is out for people to see all night.  This is a compromise everyone is good with. to protect the quilt i bought a small white water resistant square that only covers the table top, she didnt know about this when she asked for the cover and FH didnt realize it was water resistant and would in fact protect it. I said to him yesterday, that ia m too tired to go on a hunt for this thing and buy yet another thing that she is demanding (its been on going) and that what we have will just have to do and thats that. thankfully he agrees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for fuck it bucket items: we had originally planned to design itineraries and things to do pages for the welcome bags that FMIL insisted she be in charge of. Well I threw it in the bucket because she still hasnt even asked us for \"things to do\" so i dont think she is planning on having anything... and I want it off of my plate (she is not from here and will likely just google stuff - but there is a target  AMC theater, and a shopping mall with 20+ restaurants less than 1/4 mile from the hotel/venue so i feel like people can figure out what stuff to do on their own and the website and their invites all have an itinerary so it is what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm tired - anyone else?",

Now it\u2019s time for us to decide between two venues and I feel like it\u2019s all up to me. It\u2019s so stressful because I like both in different ways and they have their pros and cons. \n\nWe\u2019re Vietnamese and as traditional, my parents wanted a family style Asian dinner vs. the plated. As of now, I honestly don\u2019t care what we eat, as long as it\u2019s cost effective. On the other hand, we have signed the contract for the all-inclusive venue at a casino, but haven\u2019t paid the deposit yet so we have time to back out if we wanted to. The casino will take care of staffing, utensils, tables, chairs, silverware, etc,if we purchase minimum $100 per person for food&amp;beverage and thats not including cocktail hour which I want but it\u2019ll be a bit more expensive. The ballroom is included plus $500 for ceremony. However, since it\u2019s a casino, they are more restrictive, and we don\u2019t have the freedom to do what we want. \n\nThe Asian style venue, we would have a catering vendor and they\u2019ll take care of food, plating, utensils, cleaning up, and staffing. The venue would be separate and if we wanted to do the ceremony, we would have to rent our own chairs. However, I\u2019ve calculated the minimum I would have to do and this way is slightly more cost effective for us. It won\u2019t be as nice as a casino ballroom but we would still have our ceremony and reception all in one place. \n\nThe reason I am having a hard time making this decision is if I go with the Asian style reception, I am anticipating that I have to put in a little more work, and I live in a different state than the place I\u2019m planning on having a wedding. I also have a day of coordinator so I don\u2019t know if she will be able to take care of the work for me on day of. \n\nEssentially, the Asian style reception would make both of my families happy, especially my family. \n\nSorry for the long post but this girl can\u2019t decide on anything at all! Appreciate any opinions I can get! Thanks in advance!",

Now it\u2019s time for us to decide between two venues and I feel like it\u2019s all up to me. It\u2019s so stressful because I like both in different ways and they have their pros and cons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re Vietnamese and as traditional, my parents wanted a family style Asian dinner vs. the plated. As of now, I honestly don\u2019t care what we eat, as long as it\u2019s cost effective. On the other hand, we have signed the contract for the all-inclusive venue at a casino, but haven\u2019t paid the deposit yet so we have time to back out if we wanted to. The casino will take care of staffing, utensils, tables, chairs, silverware, etc,if we purchase minimum $100 per person for food&amp;amp;beverage and thats not including cocktail hour which I want but it\u2019ll be a bit more expensive. The ballroom is included plus $500 for ceremony. However, since it\u2019s a casino, they are more restrictive, and we don\u2019t have the freedom to do what we want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Asian style venue, we would have a catering vendor and they\u2019ll take care of food, plating, utensils, cleaning up, and staffing. The venue would be separate and if we wanted to do the ceremony, we would have to rent our own chairs. However, I\u2019ve calculated the minimum I would have to do and this way is slightly more cost effective for us. It won\u2019t be as nice as a casino ballroom but we would still have our ceremony and reception all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I am having a hard time making this decision is if I go with the Asian style reception, I am anticipating that I have to put in a little more work, and I live in a different state than the place I\u2019m planning on having a wedding. I also have a day of coordinator so I don\u2019t know if she will be able to take care of the work for me on day of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the Asian style reception would make both of my families happy, especially my family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post but this girl can\u2019t decide on anything at all! Appreciate any opinions I can get! Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Venue also provided coordinators): 34,000\nPhotography: 8500 (included engagement shoot)\nFlowers + centerpieces: 4500\nDress: 1600\nDress alterations: 1000\nVeil: 330\nHair and makeup: 1000\nCake: 550\nGroom\u2019s suit: 650\nOfficiant (donation/honorarium): 800\nBridal party gifts: 3000\nDJ (included Photo Booth): 3200\nDecor (includes a few framed photos, a canvas photo, sparklers, guest book): 350\nWedding bands: 6000\nSigns: 450\nInvitations: 220\nTips: 1300\nRehearsal lunch: 0 (paid for by groom\u2019s parents)\n\nTakeaways: \nSticker shock is real! There were times, especially in the beginning, that my husband and I questioned whether we should be spending so much on one day. But our families were really looking forward to it, and no regrets! It was a beautiful day. \n\nPlanning was very stressful for me even though I pretty much did little to no DIY. You get decision fatigue! Going with an all-inclusive venue and using some of their recommended vendors worked out great for us, since they\u2019re so used to coordinating with each other. My bridal party and I also did not have to spend much time before the wedding doing much at all other than get ourselves ready. We did not have to clean anything, just went over the next morning to pick up items left behind, which they put in a corner for us. I would say once you accept that you will spend more than you wanted, while it\u2019s still good to budget overall, some things are worth paying the extra for, rather than making yourself sick with stress, if your budget allows. Not having to worry about much during the day really helped us enjoy it! \n\nI spent more than I had initially planned on a dress, but I could not find ones I loved for a lower price. We did not care to get a videographer, but I think paying for a good photographer is worth it. We love our photos! Also, keep an area where you are getting ready tidy if you plan on getting some \u201cgetting ready\u201d or \u201cdetails\u201d photos. \n\nWe over ordered on the cakes since we weren\u2019t sure how many people would RSVP yes and had to put in our order ahead of time. Not everyone will eat cake either, so keep that in mind when you order cakes. \n\nRegarding invitations, we didn\u2019t do anything but one simple invitation with an online RSVP link. We did not do wedding favors and no one ever asked about them or seemed to miss them. \n\nIncluded some photos from my event without any people in them. Didn\u2019t include photos from the cocktail hour area (onsite) as some of our photos were displayed around there. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions!",

Venue also provided coordinators): 34,000\nPhotography: 8500 (included engagement shoot)\nFlowers + centerpieces: 4500\nDress: 1600\nDress alterations: 1000\nVeil: 330\nHair and makeup: 1000\nCake: 550\nGroom\u2019s suit: 650\nOfficiant (donation/honorarium): 800\nBridal party gifts: 3000\nDJ (included Photo Booth): 3200\nDecor (includes a few framed photos, a canvas photo, sparklers, guest book): 350\nWedding bands: 6000\nSigns: 450\nInvitations: 220\nTips: 1300\nRehearsal lunch: 0 (paid for by groom\u2019s parents)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Takeaways: \nSticker shock is real! There were times, especially in the beginning, that my husband and I questioned whether we should be spending so much on one day. But our families were really looking forward to it, and no regrets! It was a beautiful day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planning was very stressful for me even though I pretty much did little to no DIY. You get decision fatigue! Going with an all-inclusive venue and using some of their recommended vendors worked out great for us, since they\u2019re so used to coordinating with each other. My bridal party and I also did not have to spend much time before the wedding doing much at all other than get ourselves ready. We did not have to clean anything, just went over the next morning to pick up items left behind, which they put in a corner for us. I would say once you accept that you will spend more than you wanted, while it\u2019s still good to budget overall, some things are worth paying the extra for, rather than making yourself sick with stress, if your budget allows. Not having to worry about much during the day really helped us enjoy it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent more than I had initially planned on a dress, but I could not find ones I loved for a lower price. We did not care to get a videographer, but I think paying for a good photographer is worth it. We love our photos! Also, keep an area where you are getting ready tidy if you plan on getting some \u201cgetting ready\u201d or \u201cdetails\u201d photos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We over ordered on the cakes since we weren\u2019t sure how many people would RSVP yes and had to put in our order ahead of time. Not everyone will eat cake either, so keep that in mind when you order cakes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding invitations, we didn\u2019t do anything but one simple invitation with an online RSVP link. We did not do wedding favors and no one ever asked about them or seemed to miss them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Included some photos from my event without any people in them. Didn\u2019t include photos from the cocktail hour area (onsite) as some of our photos were displayed around there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask any questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We got little cute boxes filled with traditional french almonds sweets which people really liked and also fans and bottle openers (not everyone took them, but the fans were appreciated with the heat). This also includes the gifts we made to friends for organizing our bachelorettes, and to our parents for their help etc.\n\nI also made a little table with a letterbox, postal cards and enveloppes.

We've only got the teaser back, but I'm so glad we found this studio, they are so creative and we got beautiful pictures. \nWe didn't do videography but a lot of guests have filmed sections, important parts (ceremony, entrance, first dance), even though it would have been nice to have a high quality video, I don't think we will miss it. I know I will look a lot more at a physical album with pictures than a video, and we still have all the little clips to reminisce together :) . \n\nHoneymoon (Half pension and flights for 1 week, 4 star hotel in the Canary Islands) : 1200\u20ac \n\nTotal a little under 20k\u20ac\n\nTo all the fellow Europeans that lurk here, or people that are thinking of a destination wedding in Spain, maybe this will help! \n\nI was the most stressed I have ever been in my life (I'm also just a very overthinking person), there were definitely things that didn't go according to plan, but honestly it's already forgotten, and I'm just glad I got to marry my person, in a ceremony that felt like us, looking the best we ever have, and to have been able to share this moment with our multicultural family and friends. \nSo as a reminder, try to let go and enjoy the day !",

We told our families right away that we\u2019d have no wedding party and wanted this to be a pretty informal ceremony. \n\nBoth my mom and my FMIL have asked repeatedly what they are expected to wear. I told them both that I trusted their judgment to wear something appropriate. I lightheartedly said \u201cJust don\u2019t wear white.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m still getting a lot of questions that they expect specific answers about. Long dresses or short dresses? Pale colors or dark colors? Are jumpsuits/pantsuits acceptable? \n\nMy FMIL specifically said there are rules that the MOB and MOG should follow based on the color of the wedding party (I\u2019d never heard of this before) and that with no wedding party, she needs to know what color to wear. \n\nI keep trying to express that it\u2019ll be fine, whatever they choose will be great, it\u2019s not a formal ceremony. \n\nIs it normal to give this much guidance? I feel like I have enough decision fatigue from wedding planning that I don\u2019t want to decide exactly what our families should wear. They\u2019re both level-headed women and I\u2019m positive I\u2019ll be happy with whatever they choose.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not giving them *nothing* to work with. Dress code is casual. (I\u2019d prefer no jeans but the men in family will show up in jeans anyway.) Because there is no wedding party, I told them color scheme is subdued earth tones. Decor will likely vary in color. I described both my dress and my FH\u2019s planned outfit. \n\nI\u2019m sure part of it is excitement on their part! I\u2019m just not a fashion-forward person so I just want them to feel comfortable.

We told our families right away that we\u2019d have no wedding party and wanted this to be a pretty informal ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both my mom and my FMIL have asked repeatedly what they are expected to wear. I told them both that I trusted their judgment to wear something appropriate. I lightheartedly said \u201cJust don\u2019t wear white.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I\u2019m still getting a lot of questions that they expect specific answers about. Long dresses or short dresses? Pale colors or dark colors? Are jumpsuits/pantsuits acceptable? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My FMIL specifically said there are rules that the MOB and MOG should follow based on the color of the wedding party (I\u2019d never heard of this before) and that with no wedding party, she needs to know what color to wear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to express that it\u2019ll be fine, whatever they choose will be great, it\u2019s not a formal ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it normal to give this much guidance? I feel like I have enough decision fatigue from wedding planning that I don\u2019t want to decide exactly what our families should wear.

                    "selftext": "\nHi everyone!\n\nI always enjoy/appreciate the budget recap posts here, so wanted to share a very recent one of my own (while it is still fresh on my mind). I have a lot of extra narrative because I found it helpful to see how others made decisions when I was planning! The full cost with things like our hotel for the weekend, visits to deal with planning things, and the Friday night event was $45,000. The cost for the Saturday reception only was $36,000.\n\nMy husband and I got married last year in SF (where we live) at City Hall. Our parents attended that ceremony and we just did a nice lunch in a private dining room with our parents. Our expenses from that wedding aren't included in the total here. But I will outline them because it included a lot of things that folks include in their budgets. This is super long because apparently I had a lot of post-wedding thoughts!\n\nThe other thing to note, is that we did not redo our ceremony in a super formal way. We were going to but then that didn't feel quite right. So, during cocktail hour, we had my best friend gather everyone's attention. She did a short speech, we exchanged the vows from City Hall and my husband and I each said something short. It was about 5 min, folks were just hanging out where they were for cocktail hour, and we still found it to be really meaningful. \n\nJanuary 2023 City Hall Wedding\n\n$1,000 - Wedding dress, purchased in Paris at Maison Lemoine. We went to Paris and my husband suggested buying a dress here as a fun thing to do. I knew I wanted something more simple and the styles in Paris met this and I loved it\n\n$300 - dress alterations. Added cups, took it in through the waist and bodice, removed the train, extended the sleeves, this was done in SF\n\n$50 - Tie (purchased in Paris) and nice socks for my husband (he wore the suit he already owned)\n\n$50 - Bouquet purchased at a floral shopped we passed the day before walking to meet our parents for diiner\n\n$550 - 2 hours of photography at City Hall\n\n$1200 - lunch in a private dining room in Jackson Square\n\n$200 - license and ceremony fee at City Hall\n\nWe always planned to do something bigger with the rest of our friends and family. My husband doesn't like being the center of attention, so we wanted to do something smaller for the actual ceremony and then a more casual party later with less pressure. The morning of our wedding we realized that we were sad that more of the people that are important in our lives weren't with us, so that reemphasized planning a later party. But, the ceremony in City Hall was beautiful and we really got to spend time together. We got ready together at our house, wrote and read letters to each other, and had a lovely day with our families. And SF City Hall is so stunning, we are spoiled to get married here as our civil option.\n\nJune 2024 LA Wedding\n\nWe live in San Francisco, so we planned this from a distance. My husband is from Seattle, with most of his family in the PNW. I am from Denver with my family fairly evenly split between the West Coast and the Midwest. No matter where we had this wedding, folks were going to have to travel. We lived in LA for 10 years before recently moving to SF, so LA was the place where the fewest number of people would travel. We also debated about having the wedding various places, but decided LA was the easiest to get in and out of (multiple large airports, easier to navigate around than SF, reception locations where you could get by without renting a car). We have attended many weddings where we had to fly a far distance and then drive even further, and we really wanted to make it as easy as possible for folks to come to our wedding.\n\nWith that in mind, we looked at wedding venues mostly within the urban area of LA. I was in SoCal for a bachelorette party and visited about 5 venues. I went home and we realized that we wanted more of an outdoors vibe than an urban vibe (I had looked at a lot of venues in DTLA). So, we pivoted a bit and looked closer at the venues that were outside, in parks, etc. A lot of these were more DIY than I had hoped for, but I talked with my husband and we were clear on what work we would have to do.\n\nOur venue was La Tuna Canyon Ranch. It is essentially someone's house and property in the hills above Burbank. It is a super blank slate with the rental fee only covering the site, bartenders, and security. But it fit all of our criteria so perfectly. It is fully outdoors with the backdrop of La Tuna Canyon, but a 10 minute drive from downtown Burbank with access to Uber and Lyft. It could fit up to 200 people and has a stunning reception patio with trees and lights. But we absolutely needed a partial planner to help manage this venue. There are so many things I never would have thought of or dealt with without them.\n\nNow onto the budget (with more notes):\n\nVenue: $7850 (for up to 125 people, two bartenders, two security guards, access from 4pm to midnight for guests, a guest chalet to get ready in, three different spaces on the property, and golf carts to help folks with mobility impairments)\n\nCatering: $7302 (charcuterie table during cocktail hour, water, lemonade, and iced tea station from 4:30-8, buffet with salmon, steak, and chicken, warm berry cobbler with ice cream, staffing through the night bussing tables and cleaning rental plates) (if anyone is in SoCal, I would recommend my caterer so much! They only do buffet, but the price is so affordable, the owner was incredibly nice, and the food was SO SO good. The venue did not have a kitchen area, just water and electricity access, but this caterer was full self-sufficient.)\n\nRentals: $3600 (tables and chairs for dinner, tablecloths, napkins, a few tables for the cocktail area, plates, cutlery, glasses for the bar, sound system for cocktail area, 3 gas heaters, welcome table, one bar)\n\nBand: $5700 (this was a splurge, we were almost going to go with a DJ for $2100. But the band was amazing-10 piece band including a sound coordinator. They played for four hours total over our dinner and dancing and had a playlist for their set breaks. Honestly the best choice we made. My only concern was that folks didn't really dance during their set breaks, so it killed the dance floor a bit. I think if you have a band- make sure they are pumping up the set break music, to keep the crowd going.)\n\nAlcohol and Bar: $1520 (we bought all of our own alcohol. We did beer (4 options), wine (2 whites, 2 reds, and a rose), and two cocktails. We way overbought with the estimates recommended, probably by about 40%. We were able to return the non-alcoholic mixers, so this price is reduced by that. This also includes water bottles for after the caterer stopped stocking the water stations.)\n\nIce Delivery: $174 (I think this was 300 lbs. We used a lot of it and it was worth it to just get delivery.)\n\nPlanner: $3000 (this was for partial planning. I had been recommended to get a planner that was familiar with the venue because it could be tricky, as it isn't really a professional venue. The planners had done one wedding there before. I found all my own vendors, except for rentals, which is where we really needed help. They did a good job on the day and I was never stressed about anything, so that was amazing. They were key in making sure we had everything we needed in a blank slate venue.)\n\nFlowers: $700 (We did not really redo our ceremony, so I had no bouquet. My mom collected roughly 150 bud vases at goodwill over the course of a year and she and I went to the LA Flower Market on Friday morning to buy flowers and do wildflower bud vases. The hotel let us use their conference room and some family and friends came to help arrange the flowers into roughly 100 vases. The arranging took about 2.5 hours. This also includes the cost for a test run at the SF Flower Mart with a friend)\n\nOther Decorations: $384 (this includes easels, frames, votives, battery powered candles, costs for the guest book, which is going to be a quilt, and a few lawn game rentals)\n\nSignage: $273 (directional signs for the venue, table numbers (we made tables native flora and fauna to SoCal, my husband had ChatGPT draw the pictures), seating chart, crossword puzzle, and menus)\n\nHMU: $600 (I did not do a test, my blush was a little heavy, but this was honestly fine)\n\nPhotography: $3800 (6 hours, 1 photographer. We had already done portraits at SF City Hall and quite honestly I could wallpaper our living room with those photos alone. We honestly only need so many photos of ourselves. With the benefit of sort of trying this out before, we realized we just didn't need a ton of photography. What was really important to us was candid and nice pictures of the people at our wedding and we chose someone with a documentary style. She did about 30 min of portraits with our families, and then the rest of the time was photographing the party. I think she did a few shots of the space and the florals, but I am expecting a lot of candid and spontaneous shots of our guests. We did do an additional 15 min of portraits on this stunning ridgeline at the top of the property, which I am glad we did because those are gorgeous. But we saved a lot of money here because we didn't have her come early for lots of detail shots and various portraits.)\n\nTips: $720 (catering costs included tips, we tipped the band, the HMU artist, the planners)\n\nStationary and Postage: $600 (stamps for STDs, invites, thank you cards. STDs were photo postcards. Invites were one printed page, with an insert for the welcome party, and an envelope liner. We got these from Truly Engaging and their prices were really affordable and they looked great. We sent about 100 invites- we have a ton of very far flung family and invited 230 people.)\n\nAdditional Costs for the weekend:\n\nFriday night welcome event: $7010 (Hosted at a local brewery, every guest was invited. This included open wine and beer bar, taco bar and some passed apps. Was great to start getting to see folks and eased the pressure on seeing everyone on Saturday. We stayed pretty late hanging out with friends)\n\nHotel for Weekend: $1220 (We stayed at the wedding block hotel for Thurs-Mon. Roughly 50% of our guest list also stayed here, and it was honestly lovely. There were always folks around and we got just a lot of really nice casual time with our friends and families.)\n\nTravel for the wedding and two planning trips: $350 (this included gas, a couple of hotels/train tickets, to go see the venue a couple of times. We did actually book the venue before seeing it ourselves, which feels crazy.)\n\nOther weekend costs: $375 (We picked up dinner a couple of nights and a few rounds of drinks.)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nA blank slate venue was certainly as much work as we expected. Our planners weren't the best leading up to the wedding (although they were good on the day). We had the typical minor family drama, etc. We had the most fun planning out the special personal touches- picking the fabric for the quilt, creating the crossword (we made a real one with a full fill), designing the seating chart. By the end of planning, we had a lot of decision fatigue, so really went with the flow. And it all worked out! The biggest disappointment was that a lot of folks couldn't make it. I definitely shed some tears after some of the \"no\" rsvps. But I think some people didn't think it was quite as important since it was our second wedding and we accidentally picked a rough weekend for schools. In the end, we are so lucky so many people came to celebrate us and we got to spend some real quality time with the folks that were there and had a blast!\n\nI heard my husband telling his friends that the wedding was absolutely worth all of the effort in the end. He was sort of skeptical, so I think this is a great review for having one! We had so much fun and it was absolutely incredible to get to have our friends and family all in one place. That experience will never be replicated. \n\nI am really happy to pass along vendors, advice, etc. to brides. I feel a bit weird about just putting our faces out on reddit, but happy to share photos of specific decor if folks want!",

I have a lot of extra narrative because I found it helpful to see how others made decisions when I was planning! The full cost with things like our hotel for the weekend, visits to deal with planning things, and the Friday night event was $45,000. The cost for the Saturday reception only was $36,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband and I got married last year in SF (where we live) at City Hall. Our parents attended that ceremony and we just did a nice lunch in a private dining room with our parents. Our expenses from that wedding aren&amp;#39;t included in the total here. But I will outline them because it included a lot of things that folks include in their budgets. This is super long because apparently I had a lot of post-wedding thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing to note, is that we did not redo our ceremony in a super formal way. We were going to but then that didn&amp;#39;t feel quite right. So, during cocktail hour, we had my best friend gather everyone&amp;#39;s attention. She did a short speech, we exchanged the vows from City Hall and my husband and I each said something short. It was about 5 min, folks were just hanging out where they were for cocktail hour, and we still found it to be really meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;January 2023 City Hall Wedding&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$1,000 - Wedding dress, purchased in Paris at Maison Lemoine. We went to Paris and my husband suggested buying a dress here as a fun thing to do. I knew I wanted something more simple and the styles in Paris met this and I loved it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$300 - dress alterations. Added cups, took it in through the waist and bodice, removed the train, extended the sleeves, this was done in SF&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$50 - Tie (purchased in Paris) and nice socks for my husband (he wore the suit he already owned)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$50 - Bouquet purchased at a floral shopped we passed the day before walking to meet our parents for diiner&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$550 - 2 hours of photography at City Hall&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$1200 - lunch in a private dining room in Jackson Square&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$200 - license and ceremony fee at City Hall&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always planned to do something bigger with the rest of our friends and family. My husband doesn&amp;#39;t like being the center of attention, so we wanted to do something smaller for the actual ceremony and then a more casual party later with less pressure. The morning of our wedding we realized that we were sad that more of the people that are important in our lives weren&amp;#39;t with us, so that reemphasized planning a later party. But, the ceremony in City Hall was beautiful and we really got to spend time together. We got ready together at our house, wrote and read letters to each other, and had a lovely day with our families. And SF City Hall is so stunning, we are spoiled to get married here as our civil option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;June 2024 LA Wedding&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live in San Francisco, so we planned this from a distance. My husband is from Seattle, with most of his family in the PNW. I am from Denver with my family fairly evenly split between the West Coast and the Midwest. No matter where we had this wedding, folks were going to have to travel. We lived in LA for 10 years before recently moving to SF, so LA was the place where the fewest number of people would travel. We also debated about having the wedding various places, but decided LA was the easiest to get in and out of (multiple large airports, easier to navigate around than SF, reception locations where you could get by without renting a car). We have attended many weddings where we had to fly a far distance and then drive even further, and we really wanted to make it as easy as possible for folks to come to our wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we looked at wedding venues mostly within the urban area of LA. I was in SoCal for a bachelorette party and visited about 5 venues. I went home and we realized that we wanted more of an outdoors vibe than an urban vibe (I had looked at a lot of venues in DTLA). So, we pivoted a bit and looked closer at the venues that were outside, in parks, etc. A lot of these were more DIY than I had hoped for, but I talked with my husband and we were clear on what work we would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our venue was La Tuna Canyon Ranch. It is essentially someone&amp;#39;s house and property in the hills above Burbank. It is a super blank slate with the rental fee only covering the site, bartenders, and security. But it fit all of our criteria so perfectly. It is fully outdoors with the backdrop of La Tuna Canyon, but a 10 minute drive from downtown Burbank with access to Uber and Lyft. It could fit up to 200 people and has a stunning reception patio with trees and lights. But we absolutely needed a partial planner to help manage this venue. There are so many things I never would have thought of or dealt with without them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now onto the budget (with more notes):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Venue: $7850 (for up to 125 people, two bartenders, two security guards, access from 4pm to midnight for guests, a guest chalet to get ready in, three different spaces on the property, and golf carts to help folks with mobility impairments)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Catering: $7302 (charcuterie table during cocktail hour, water, lemonade, and iced tea station from 4:30-8, buffet with salmon, steak, and chicken, warm berry cobbler with ice cream, staffing through the night bussing tables and cleaning rental plates) (if anyone is in SoCal, I would recommend my caterer so much! They only do buffet, but the price is so affordable, the owner was incredibly nice, and the food was SO SO good. The venue did not have a kitchen area, just water and electricity access, but this caterer was full self-sufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rentals: $3600 (tables and chairs for dinner, tablecloths, napkins, a few tables for the cocktail area, plates, cutlery, glasses for the bar, sound system for cocktail area, 3 gas heaters, welcome table, one bar)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Band: $5700 (this was a splurge, we were almost going to go with a DJ for $2100. But the band was amazing-10 piece band including a sound coordinator. They played for four hours total over our dinner and dancing and had a playlist for their set breaks. Honestly the best choice we made. My only concern was that folks didn&amp;#39;t really dance during their set breaks, so it killed the dance floor a bit. I think if you have a band- make sure they are pumping up the set break music, to keep the crowd going.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and Bar: $1520 (we bought all of our own alcohol. We did beer (4 options), wine (2 whites, 2 reds, and a rose), and two cocktails. We way overbought with the estimates recommended, probably by about 40%. We were able to return the non-alcoholic mixers, so this price is reduced by that. This also includes water bottles for after the caterer stopped stocking the water stations.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice Delivery: $174 (I think this was 300 lbs. We used a lot of it and it was worth it to just get delivery.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planner: $3000 (this was for partial planning. I had been recommended to get a planner that was familiar with the venue because it could be tricky, as it isn&amp;#39;t really a professional venue. The planners had done one wedding there before. I found all my own vendors, except for rentals, which is where we really needed help. They did a good job on the day and I was never stressed about anything, so that was amazing. They were key in making sure we had everything we needed in a blank slate venue.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flowers: $700 (We did not really redo our ceremony, so I had no bouquet. My mom collected roughly 150 bud vases at goodwill over the course of a year and she and I went to the LA Flower Market on Friday morning to buy flowers and do wildflower bud vases. The hotel let us use their conference room and some family and friends came to help arrange the flowers into roughly 100 vases. The arranging took about 2.5 hours. This also includes the cost for a test run at the SF Flower Mart with a friend)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Decorations: $384 (this includes easels, frames, votives, battery powered candles, costs for the guest book, which is going to be a quilt, and a few lawn game rentals)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Signage: $273 (directional signs for the venue, table numbers (we made tables native flora and fauna to SoCal, my husband had ChatGPT draw the pictures), seating chart, crossword puzzle, and menus)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HMU: $600 (I did not do a test, my blush was a little heavy, but this was honestly fine)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photography: $3800 (6 hours, 1 photographer. We had already done portraits at SF City Hall and quite honestly I could wallpaper our living room with those photos alone. We honestly only need so many photos of ourselves. With the benefit of sort of trying this out before, we realized we just didn&amp;#39;t need a ton of photography. What was really important to us was candid and nice pictures of the people at our wedding and we chose someone with a documentary style. She did about 30 min of portraits with our families, and then the rest of the time was photographing the party. I think she did a few shots of the space and the florals, but I am expecting a lot of candid and spontaneous shots of our guests. We did do an additional 15 min of portraits on this stunning ridgeline at the top of the property, which I am glad we did because those are gorgeous. But we saved a lot of money here because we didn&amp;#39;t have her come early for lots of detail shots and various portraits.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tips: $720 (catering costs included tips, we tipped the band, the HMU artist, the planners)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stationary and Postage: $600 (stamps for STDs, invites, thank you cards. STDs were photo postcards. Invites were one printed page, with an insert for the welcome party, and an envelope liner. We got these from Truly Engaging and their prices were really affordable and they looked great. We sent about 100 invites- we have a ton of very far flung family and invited 230 people.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional Costs for the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday night welcome event: $7010 (Hosted at a local brewery, every guest was invited. This included open wine and beer bar, taco bar and some passed apps. Was great to start getting to see folks and eased the pressure on seeing everyone on Saturday. We stayed pretty late hanging out with friends)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotel for Weekend: $1220 (We stayed at the wedding block hotel for Thurs-Mon. Roughly 50% of our guest list also stayed here, and it was honestly lovely. There were always folks around and we got just a lot of really nice casual time with our friends and families.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Travel for the wedding and two planning trips: $350 (this included gas, a couple of hotels/train tickets, to go see the venue a couple of times. We did actually book the venue before seeing it ourselves, which feels crazy.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other weekend costs: $375 (We picked up dinner a couple of nights and a few rounds of drinks.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A blank slate venue was certainly as much work as we expected. Our planners weren&amp;#39;t the best leading up to the wedding (although they were good on the day). We had the typical minor family drama, etc. We had the most fun planning out the special personal touches- picking the fabric for the quilt, creating the crossword (we made a real one with a full fill), designing the seating chart. By the end of planning, we had a lot of decision fatigue, so really went with the flow. And it all worked out! The biggest disappointment was that a lot of folks couldn&amp;#39;t make it. I definitely shed some tears after some of the &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; rsvps. But I think some people didn&amp;#39;t think it was quite as important since it was our second wedding and we accidentally picked a rough weekend for schools. In the end, we are so lucky so many people came to celebrate us and we got to spend some real quality time with the folks that were there and had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard my husband telling his friends that the wedding was absolutely worth all of the effort in the end. He was sort of skeptical, so I think this is a great review for having one! We had so much fun and it was absolutely incredible to get to have our friends and family all in one place. That experience will never be replicated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really happy to pass along vendors, advice, etc. to brides. I feel a bit weird about just putting our faces out on reddit, but happy to share photos of specific decor if folks want!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Feel free to DM with questions, and happy wedding planning &lt;3\n\n**WHEN:** June 2024\n\n**WHERE:** 45 minutes from Rome (San Gregorio da Sassola)\n\n**ACTUAL COST:** \u20ac70k\n\n**GUESTS IN ATTENDANCE:** 64\u00a0\n\n**Venue cost per guest (excluding external vendors like HMU, photographer, etc.):** \u20ac815 incl. accommodation\n\n**Why Rome:** since we live abroad, we did not want to deal with hosting a wedding in the US (as well as the the insanity of US wedding costs). In our research we found our money could go a lot farther in other locations, and eventually we gravitated towards Italy. Additionally, our friends and family are spread out all across the US and Europe, so there was no single location that would have made sense to minimize travel.\n\n**Our Vision:** \u00a0as most of our guests were flying in for the wedding, we wanted to spend multiple days with them so that we could properly catch up and make some nice memories together. Initially we had intended to do a smaller group with all guests staying at a villa or agriturismo, but had trouble finding venues that could accommodate our group. After seeing our (eventual) wedding venue, we decided to make the group a bit bigger since it had hotel capacity.\n\n**Finances**: we were ready and able to cover the entire costs ourselves, but we were lucky enough to have some generous gifts from a couple of family members to offset some of the costs. We chose to pass a lot of these savings on to our guests (see accommodation).\n\n**Accommodation**: we split the accommodation between our wedding venue (castle with rooms for 33 people) and a nearby agriturismo (31 people). Because we were received some financial help from  generous family, so we chose to pass this on to our guests and cover everyone\u2019s accommodation since people were traveling so far for us.\n\n**Wedding Weekend Agenda**\n\n* Day 1: Check-in and Welcome Dinner\n* Day 2: Wedding Day\n* Day 3: Pool party, then Farewell Dinner\n* Day 4: Departure\n\n**Cost Breakdown**\n\nCastle hotel (3 nights full booking for 2 suites, 13 doubles, 1 single, 1 bridal suite, 1 tower suite): \u20ac9,500\n\nAgriturismo hotel (3 nights full booking for 18 double rooms): \u20ac6,400\n\nWelcome Dinner (open bar + small plate dinner): \u20ac3,800\n\nWedding Day:\u00a0\n\n* Wedding party lunch: \u20ac200\n* Bar for guests arriving: \u20ac270\n* Cocktail hour open bar: \u20ac1,000\n* Cocktail hour finger food: \u20ac600\n* Dinner (\u20ac73): \u20ac4,700\n* Dinner open bar: \u20ac1,500\n* Add-on cocktail package (250 drinks): \u20ac2200\n\nPool party &amp; Farewell Dinner\n\n* Open bar and lunch (65 guests): \u20ac2800\n* Farewell pizza dinner (65 guests): \u20ac960\n\nOther\n\n* Breakfast (3 days): \u20ac3,200\n* Staff costs across all events: \u20ac3,600\n* Wedding day vendor meals (5): \u20ac500\n* Airport and wedding day shuttle (roundtrip): \u20ac2,420\n* HMU (bride + 2 bridesmaids): \u20ac1,000\n* Photographer: \u20ac5,200\n* Flowers: \u20ac500\n* Videographer: \u20ac900\n* DJ (ceremony + dinner + party): \u20ac2,700\u00a0\n\n**What We Saved On**\n\n* **Shuttles**: a number of guests ended up renting cars to get around, so we only needed shuttles for a portion of our guests\n* **Flowers**: the castle was such a striking venue that we did not need to decorate very much. We purchased some flowers from a local florist and had family put together arrangements for the ceremony and bouquet (white roses, white lisianthus, white delphinium, eucalyptus, chrysanthemum).\n* **Wedding planner**: we did all the planning and coordination ourselves. It ended up being a lot of work, but I\u2019m not convinced that having a wedding planner during the planning stages would have resulted in much less stress (which came mostly from decision fatigue and trying to get answers from the venue). Having a day-of coordinator probably would have been nice, but not sure it would have been worth the cost given that everything went off well enough without one.\u00a0\n* **Stationery &amp; signage**: we DIY\u2019d all of our stationery design and printing\n* **Symbolic ceremony**: we\u2019ll get legally married in the US, so we did not have to deal with getting married in Italy (which is not the easiest thing to do).\n* **Videographer**: our videographer gave us a screamin\u2019 deal, as she was interested in building an international portfolio\n* **Photographer**: although the sticker price might look high, this included a second shooter as well as a dedicated bridals session, which was a full photoshoot in Rome after the wedding.\n* **Not having the wedding in the US**: for the money we spent, we were able to have a full wedding weekend including covering all guests\u2019 rooms. Definitely would not have been possible for this price in the States.\n* **Centerpieces**: we bought candles and glass vases from IKEA in Italy, and put together our own centerpieces with flowers that we purchased from the local florist\n* **Her Dress:** purchased from lulus. com, they have a terrific wedding collection. If you contact their Support, they are very accommodating about allowing for returns of dresses after trying a bunch (above their normal return limit).\n\n**What We Splurged On**\n\n* **Accommodations**: we were lucky enough to be able to cover everyone\u2019s rooms for the weekend.\u00a0\n* **His Suit**: I went with a custom white suit, which fortunately matched well with her dress.\n* **Stationery / Signage**: while it saved us in cost, we spent a lot of time on designing and printing things like note cards, logo, welcome signs, etc. We had a really fun time doing this, but it was definitely a \u201csplurge\u201d in how much time &amp; effort we spent on it.\n\n**What I'm Glad We Did**\n\n* **Advanced notice and frequent communication:** we recognised that asking everyone to travel so far was a lot, so tried to communicate as much as possible and give people the exact information they needed. We are lucky to have adventurous and capable friends &amp; family, so logistics and planning worked out as well as you could hope.\u00a0\n* **Organized guest accommodations** - although our preference would have been to host everyone in one location, being able to secure and pay for everyone\u2019s accommodations was a nice win. It definitely helped reduce stress among family members who do not travel much, and many guests thanked us for the gesture.\n* **Welcome Dinner, Pool Party, Farewell Dinner:** being able to socialize with all of our guests across multiple days was really nice. We avoided the \u201cmy wedding was a blur\u201d syndrome, and got to have intimate and special moments with so many people. I would highly recommend a pool party as a post-wedding activity, as it gives everyone something to do but also allows everyone to relax and recover from the festivities.\n* **Videographer**: this was a relatively late decision after we spoke with a few other brides. We are very happy with the finished products, and it provides such a rich memory of the event. The videographer and photographer also knew eachother, so they worked well together and were never intrusive or noticeable.\n\n**What I Would Do Differently**\n\n* **Informing helpers**: we had plenty of family and friends who wanted to help in the lead-up and on the wedding day, but could have informed them better about what would be helpful. We made really organized spreadsheets, but our helpers were sometimes lacking context or needed more individual direction. Everything came out just fine, but we could have smoothed over some rough edges here and there.\n* **Vow writing**: we were both having trouble getting past writer\u2019s block, and so ended up being a bit stressed in the days before the wedding. Start early, and try to finish your vows before you go into your wedding weekend \ud83d\ude42\n* **Day-of coordination**: even if you do not have a wedding planner/coordinator, find someone reliable who can be on call to coordinate with vendors. For example, our DJ was arriving an hour before the ceremony, and I (the husband) had to step out and get the DJ squared away as I was getting ready for pictures. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice to have that taken care of by someone else.\n* **Venue coordination**: coordinating and negotiating with our venue was the biggest stressor during the planning process. We'll have a whole other post with a venue review, if you are interested to read about our experience.",

If you contact their Support, they are very accommodating about allowing for returns of dresses after trying a bunch (above their normal return limit).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Splurged On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodations&lt;/strong&gt;: we were lucky enough to be able to cover everyone\u2019s rooms for the weekend.\u00a0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His Suit&lt;/strong&gt;: I went with a custom white suit, which fortunately matched well with her dress.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stationery / Signage&lt;/strong&gt;: while it saved us in cost, we spent a lot of time on designing and printing things like note cards, logo, welcome signs, etc. We had a really fun time doing this, but it was definitely a \u201csplurge\u201d in how much time &amp;amp; effort we spent on it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;m Glad We Did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced notice and frequent communication:&lt;/strong&gt; we recognised that asking everyone to travel so far was a lot, so tried to communicate as much as possible and give people the exact information they needed. We are lucky to have adventurous and capable friends &amp;amp; family, so logistics and planning worked out as well as you could hope.\u00a0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized guest accommodations&lt;/strong&gt; - although our preference would have been to host everyone in one location, being able to secure and pay for everyone\u2019s accommodations was a nice win. It definitely helped reduce stress among family members who do not travel much, and many guests thanked us for the gesture.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome Dinner, Pool Party, Farewell Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt; being able to socialize with all of our guests across multiple days was really nice. We avoided the \u201cmy wedding was a blur\u201d syndrome, and got to have intimate and special moments with so many people. I would highly recommend a pool party as a post-wedding activity, as it gives everyone something to do but also allows everyone to relax and recover from the festivities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videographer&lt;/strong&gt;: this was a relatively late decision after we spoke with a few other brides. We are very happy with the finished products, and it provides such a rich memory of the event. The videographer and photographer also knew eachother, so they worked well together and were never intrusive or noticeable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Would Do Differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informing helpers&lt;/strong&gt;: we had plenty of family and friends who wanted to help in the lead-up and on the wedding day, but could have informed them better about what would be helpful. We made really organized spreadsheets, but our helpers were sometimes lacking context or needed more individual direction. Everything came out just fine, but we could have smoothed over some rough edges here and there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vow writing&lt;/strong&gt;: we were both having trouble getting past writer\u2019s block, and so ended up being a bit stressed in the days before the wedding. Start early, and try to finish your vows before you go into your wedding weekend \ud83d\ude42&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day-of coordination&lt;/strong&gt;: even if you do not have a wedding planner/coordinator, find someone reliable who can be on call to coordinate with vendors. For example, our DJ was arriving an hour before the ceremony, and I (the husband) had to step out and get the DJ squared away as I was getting ready for pictures. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice to have that taken care of by someone else.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue coordination&lt;/strong&gt;: coordinating and negotiating with our venue was the biggest stressor during the planning process. We&amp;#39;ll have a whole other post with a venue review, if you are interested to read about our experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The past two weeks have been stressful with wedding related family drama and last minute changes and decisions that needed to be made. \n\nI have serious decision fatigue and am exhausted of needing to respond to wedding related questions from vendors and guests, especially to questions answered on our wedding website. \n\nI also feel extremely anxious about everything that could go wrong. Most of my family and wedding party are flying in on Wednesday and I\u2019m anxious about their flights getting cancelled due to the IT meltdown last week or weather. Of course we\u2019re expecting thunderstorms on Wednesday when everyone is flying in. I\u2019m also anxious about an unforeseen historic world event happening and ruining everything. \n\nI also feel guilty because my partner is feeling anxious. He\u2019s an introvert and I know he hates being the center of attention. He loves me so much and I know that if it was up to him we would not have a traditional wedding but he\u2019s compromising on what he wants to make me happy, which I appreciate but I hate to see him stressed and anxious. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? Will I eventually be excited or should I expect to just stay anxious until it\u2019s all over? I really wish I could be excited but there is so much on my mind. ",

The past two weeks have been stressful with wedding related family drama and last minute changes and decisions that needed to be made. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have serious decision fatigue and am exhausted of needing to respond to wedding related questions from vendors and guests, especially to questions answered on our wedding website. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel extremely anxious about everything that could go wrong. Most of my family and wedding party are flying in on Wednesday and I\u2019m anxious about their flights getting cancelled due to the IT meltdown last week or weather. Of course we\u2019re expecting thunderstorms on Wednesday when everyone is flying in. I\u2019m also anxious about an unforeseen historic world event happening and ruining everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel guilty because my partner is feeling anxious. He\u2019s an introvert and I know he hates being the center of attention. He loves me so much and I know that if it was up to him we would not have a traditional wedding but he\u2019s compromising on what he wants to make me happy, which I appreciate but I hate to see him stressed and anxious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone experienced this? Will I eventually be excited or should I expect to just stay anxious until it\u2019s all over? I really wish I could be excited but there is so much on my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm a few weeks from my wedding (yay!!!), and have some tips for anyone just starting out that I wish someone would have told me a year ago.\n\n* Immediately start a special wedding email address for all wedding related correspondence that you and your partner can share access to.  Vendors will NOT remember to CC your partner on their replies and having joint access and everything in one spot is a huge plus.   \n* Have a shared vision of you and your partners' expectations before you get into planning.  You don't want bad surprises when big decisions have already been made.  Understand what money, time, and other resources you and your partner (or family/friends) are comfortable with committing.  Understand that if others are helping pay, they may want their preferences taken into account.  \n* Make your own wedding website if you are remotely able to.  All the wedding website brands are terrible and limited in my experience.  If I were going to do it again, I would build by own website and utilize Google Forms for RSVPs and PayPal/Venmo/etc. for a honeymoon registry without all the fuss and limitations of one of the standard sites.  They are so aggravating to use.  \n* Most so-called \"Bridezillas\" are just exhausted people doing their best with no experience planning an event of this scale, limited resources, and a TON of pressure to make this \"once in a lifetime\" event special.  There will be SO MUCH pressure and decision fatigue.  Prepare yourself, plan ahead, and try to be adaptable.  Give yourself and other people planning a wedding a break - it's tough!\n\nAnyone else have tips they wish they knew initially?",

I&amp;#39;m a few weeks from my wedding (yay!!!), and have some tips for anyone just starting out that I wish someone would have told me a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Immediately start a special wedding email address for all wedding related correspondence that you and your partner can share access to.  Vendors will NOT remember to CC your partner on their replies and having joint access and everything in one spot is a huge plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a shared vision of you and your partners&amp;#39; expectations before you get into planning.  You don&amp;#39;t want bad surprises when big decisions have already been made.  Understand what money, time, and other resources you and your partner (or family/friends) are comfortable with committing.  Understand that if others are helping pay, they may want their preferences taken into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make your own wedding website if you are remotely able to.  All the wedding website brands are terrible and limited in my experience.  If I were going to do it again, I would build by own website and utilize Google Forms for RSVPs and PayPal/Venmo/etc. for a honeymoon registry without all the fuss and limitations of one of the standard sites.  They are so aggravating to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most so-called &amp;quot;Bridezillas&amp;quot; are just exhausted people doing their best with no experience planning an event of this scale, limited resources, and a TON of pressure to make this &amp;quot;once in a lifetime&amp;quot; event special.  There will be SO MUCH pressure and decision fatigue.  Prepare yourself, plan ahead, and try to be adaptable.  Give yourself and other people planning a wedding a break - it&amp;#39;s tough!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have tips they wish they knew initially?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We planned our wedding showers to be the same weekend at the end of June (me on Saturday, her on Sunday) so I could minimize my travel. This was decided very early on. It's been a lot of fun sharing all of this together, and she honestly has been the best support system.\n\nMy FMIL, who has been engaged for almost 10 years, decided months after FH and I got engaged that they were going to get married at the end of July. The day after my best friend (where I am a bridesmaid). They are going to elope and don't want anyone there, but she planned a 4-day bachelorette trip for herself and made it a mother-daughters thing. I am very much looking forward to it and excited to bond more with FMIL and FSIL. This trip is the weekend after my bestie's bach trip.\n\nFH has not visited his brother or nephews in a year, and my FBIL is going through some marital troubles. We planned a road trip to visit them for Memorial Day weekend (they live 5 hours away). I am looking forward to the getaway, even if I have to reign in my irritation/rage with FBIL's wife because I know too much of his side of things.\n\nI have a project for work that requires an international site visit. My boss asked if I could go on 5/27 for the week. I told him that is Memorial Day, so he replied, \"OK...then Tuesday.\" So now I'm going out of the country for the week after I return from FBIL's.\n\nI had a business trip two weeks ago that was cancelled while I was \\*in transit\\* to the destination. I turned around and came back home. It has now been rescheduled for the day before my FMIL's bachelorette trip. Cool.\n\nLast week my mom tells me that her and my step-dad (together 27 years, never officially married) are having a wedding on June 1st. Beyond excited for them, especially given my step-dad's health struggles the last two years. My aunt is hosting and orchestrated the whole thing as a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was intended to be a JP courthouse wedding originally, but Aunt has now made it a big backyard family celebration. I adore this for my mom. What I don't adore is the now 2-week rush to plan a wedding for my parents, where my mom texts and calls non-stop with questions and asking me to make decisions for her. She literally called me at 10:30 PM last night to ask me what the guys should wear. I had to pick the color palette and flowers because it was all to be based on a dress I already own. I'm being pulled into every detail...and I am tired. I was already past the point of decision fatigue while planning my own wedding and consulting on my best friend's choices. I do not have the mental capacity for this.\n\nA recap for my travel now...\n\n5/25-5/27: Road trip to visit FH's family\n\n5/28-5/31: International business trip\n\n5/31-6/2: Flying to hometown for my mom's wedding\n\n6/7-6/9: Best friend's bachelorette trip\n\n6/12: Business daytrip (flying to and back same day)\n\n6/13-6/16: FMIL's bachelorette trip \n\n6/28-6/30: Flying to hometown for both mine &amp; bestie's wedding showers\n\n\n\nThis past Sunday on Mother's Day, my FMIL implied I wasn't expressing enough excitement for her bachelorette trip. She's also disappointed I won't be staying with her the night before we leave for the airport, because I'm getting in late from my business trip. I'm sensitive to this given that she is paying for the whole weekend, but I am exhausted and cannot think about it today. I have FOUR places to be before then. I will be excited when I get there, but please wait for that moment. \n\nIn the meantime, I'm trying to figure out laundry, a clean home, who is watching the dog next month, still staying on top of my wedding planning to-do list (had a major issue come in this morning regarding invitations), need to coordinate my MOG gift (another major project), and wrap up craft projects assigned to me for the wedding shower. I want nothing more than to lock myself in a room this weekend and talk to nobody, but know that is unrealistic. \n\nI'm not looking for a solution to any of this and know that it will all work itself out, but today I am in my feels and PMS'ing, and just need to scream because I have already ate two chocolate chip muffins today due to stress and a third seems extreme.

We generally dont give birthday or Christmas presents as we prefer to spend quality time as a group rather than stress about what to get everyone (or we do a white elephant party with gag gifts... aka my wheelhouse). Decision fatigue has stripped me of the ability to think of anything *good*.\n \nI would like to have something that can tie in with the rest of my bridal party as this is a bit of a tradition within our group. For the most part, we've all been in each other's weddings, so we all have the same or similar varying tokens of appreciation that we can reminisce with at our gatherings.\n\n____________________________\n\nHello all! I'm hoping to get some help as I am genuinely not great at gift giving. We're still about 5 months out, but I'm trying to plan ahead.\n\nI have 4 bridesmaids, a MOH and a Dude of Honor. \n\nWhen I asked them to be in our wedding, I gifted them the typical proposal boxes with a candle, custom tumbler (with just their names), and I think one other thing... That was a solid option for everybody since the candle and Tumblers weren't too overly feminine.\n\nBut now I'm struggling on what to do for them as a thank you at the rehearsal dinner... I'd like to give them something they can use that doesn't scream \"bridesmaid\", but what I've been finding doesn't necessarily work for my Dude. I get that I'll likely have to get him something more tailored for him, but I don't want it to be vastly different.\n\nThey all came together to throw me an AMAZING bridal shower and my Dude even handmade a GORGEOUS cake for the event, so I do want to show my gratitude while also keeping my budget in mind (we're in a good place, but a few hundred extra dollars here and there will add up).\n\nSolid chance I'm overthinking this, but figured I'd ask the experts here.\n\nTIA",

We generally dont give birthday or Christmas presents as we prefer to spend quality time as a group rather than stress about what to get everyone (or we do a white elephant party with gag gifts... aka my wheelhouse). Decision fatigue has stripped me of the ability to think of anything &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to have something that can tie in with the rest of my bridal party as this is a bit of a tradition within our group. For the most part, we&amp;#39;ve all been in each other&amp;#39;s weddings, so we all have the same or similar varying tokens of appreciation that we can reminisce with at our gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello all! I&amp;#39;m hoping to get some help as I am genuinely not great at gift giving. We&amp;#39;re still about 5 months out, but I&amp;#39;m trying to plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 4 bridesmaids, a MOH and a Dude of Honor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked them to be in our wedding, I gifted them the typical proposal boxes with a candle, custom tumbler (with just their names), and I think one other thing... That was a solid option for everybody since the candle and Tumblers weren&amp;#39;t too overly feminine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I&amp;#39;m struggling on what to do for them as a thank you at the rehearsal dinner... I&amp;#39;d like to give them something they can use that doesn&amp;#39;t scream &amp;quot;bridesmaid&amp;quot;, but what I&amp;#39;ve been finding doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily work for my Dude. I get that I&amp;#39;ll likely have to get him something more tailored for him, but I don&amp;#39;t want it to be vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all came together to throw me an AMAZING bridal shower and my Dude even handmade a GORGEOUS cake for the event, so I do want to show my gratitude while also keeping my budget in mind (we&amp;#39;re in a good place, but a few hundred extra dollars here and there will add up).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solid chance I&amp;#39;m overthinking this, but figured I&amp;#39;d ask the experts here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TIA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Like for invites, what site do you order from, what style do you want, how much do you want to spend, etc etc. I just keep getting overwhelmed by it all. \n\nSo like I\u2019ll spend all this time looking for save the dates on 5 different sites, looking at all the styles, and prices, and get overwhelmed. I explain this to my my fianc\u00e9 and he\u2019s just like oh, I\u2019ll just go to the first site I see for save the dates, here this second one looks nice.  Boom. Done. Like once he sat down with me we did the whole thing and it took 30 minutes. But I\u2019ve probably already spend collectively a few hours looking and getting overwhelmed by this task alone over the last month or so. Full disclosure I do have ADHD, so that\u2019s certainly not helping. Still though\u2026\n\nAny suggestions? How do you stop from getting overwhelmed? How do you make a choice and stick to it? I feel like I have constant decision fatigue without making decisions. I don\u2019t normally have this much difficulty with this. lol but the wedding feels like a one time thing so I have to do it \u201cright\u201d",

Like for invites, what site do you order from, what style do you want, how much do you want to spend, etc etc. I just keep getting overwhelmed by it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like I\u2019ll spend all this time looking for save the dates on 5 different sites, looking at all the styles, and prices, and get overwhelmed. I explain this to my my fianc\u00e9 and he\u2019s just like oh, I\u2019ll just go to the first site I see for save the dates, here this second one looks nice.  Boom. Done. Like once he sat down with me we did the whole thing and it took 30 minutes. But I\u2019ve probably already spend collectively a few hours looking and getting overwhelmed by this task alone over the last month or so. Full disclosure I do have ADHD, so that\u2019s certainly not helping. Still though\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? How do you stop from getting overwhelmed? How do you make a choice and stick to it? I feel like I have constant decision fatigue without making decisions. I don\u2019t normally have this much difficulty with this. lol but the wedding feels like a one time thing so I have to do it \u201cright\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Do not tell anyone what you are \"thinking about\" concerning wedding planning until you have discussed with your fiance your budget, your tentative invites guest list, wedding planning task responsibilities, and what is important to you out of this wedding. Write this stuff down. If your parents are helping pay, loop them in after this conversation and realize that it gives them a feeling of ownership of wedding decisions. \n\n2. My parents began verbally inviting people without telling me. To avoid this, make sure you have conversations with your parents about expectations and how they want to be involved. Tell them that before anybody is invited, the guest list needs to be finalized. If you are sharing your guest list with them to refine, make sure you have locked down the people you both want there first. \n\n3. People want to be involved but they don't want to make decisions. You will get a lot of opinions. Create intentional space for feedback and where you review to improve. Involve people in ways that play to their strengths. \n\n4. Keep gauging your partner's health and happiness. Make sure you put that over your parents wants. I learned how to be a spouse during this experience instead of someone's child.

To avoid this, make sure you have conversations with your parents about expectations and how they want to be involved. Tell them that before anybody is invited, the guest list needs to be finalized. If you are sharing your guest list with them to refine, make sure you have locked down the people you both want there first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People want to be involved but they don&amp;#39;t want to make decisions.

                    "selftext": "We made the official moves to cancel our wedding this week - notifying wedding party, then guests, then vendors. We don't plan to have the same big party, and are instead hoping to get married as soon as City Hall opens back up for us to get a license, and doing a smaller Catholic ceremony/reception once this is all over. As a final farewell to the would-be wedding, I wanted to still post a budget recap as we had taken a lot of effort to budget for everything needed. Some of this stuff is obviously an estimation as it would have depended on our final numbers, but this was our general estimates based on 220 guests. Wish I could have written this with photos to share, but I still hope it offers some clarity for couples planning a big wedding in a HCOL area. I included comments on my negotiations as well as how cancellation worked with these vendors. \n\n**Financial Summary**\n\n**Total Cost of the Wedding: \\~$45K**\n\nOur financial contribution: $40K\n\nMy mom's financial contribution: $5K wedding gift, plus floral costs/labor and other expenses picked up here and there\n\n\\*Additional spending not included in budget (rings, outfits, alterations): $5760\n\n\\*\\*Total value of discounts and negotiations: \\~$4200\n\n\\*\\*\\*Total value of wedding if you included discounts and additional spending: \\~$54,960\n\n**Breakdown**\n\n**Venue &amp; Insurance - $6500**\n\n\\- Seventh/Place venue ($6500)  Venue was going to be the Seventh/Place in DTLA. It's a renovated warehouse space that fit our large guest count, had a lovely outdoor patio, had a 16 hour rental period and included tables and chairs as part of the rental price. Pricing also came with uplights lining the walls,string lights across the ceiling, and 2 security guards. It was a really simple but romantic space, and felt very us.  They also had a full open vendor policy (except for florals and valet) so we could really shop around and find solutions to fit our budget. *Price was originally $7150, negotiated a $650 discount for paying upfront. They have a Force Majeure clause and I requested 100% of our payment back on Friday. Still waiting to hear back from them but this is one I intend to fight tooth and nail for.* \n\n**Food and Beverage - $24,894.03**\n\n\\- [Hungry Bear Catering](http://www.hungrybearcatering.com/) (Would have been $18007.28, we paid a $7946 deposit)  Food was my #1 priority and going to be the biggest expense. Most traditional caterers were priced pretty similarly with more 'meh' food, and if I was going to spend thousands on catering, I wanted it to be memorable. This price includes 3 passed apps (tofu baos, crab cakes, beef tataki) and a family style meal of bread/butter/furikake chex mix on the table, 1 salad course, 2 mains (filet mignon and miso salmon), and 2 sides (fish glazed brussel sprouts and miso carbonara). Anyone with dietary restrictions got their own meal, as did kids. They also provided cake cutting, 3 welcome drinks, and coffee/tea service in this price. Price does not include equipment which we had to rent separately. *Their base price is usually $80/person before tax and service charges, but we were able to negotiate down to $66.50/person without removing any services. Per the contract we would have gotten 50% of the deposit back for cancellation, but we decided to have them keep the cost and are working with them to donate meals to a food bank instead* \n\n\\- MTB Event Rentals ($2300)  Estimate for bring in glassware, serving ware for the tables, and a full kitchen setup. MTB had the most reasonable prices and were great to work with. *We were able to cancel and get 100% of our deposit back.* \n\n\\- Linens/Table Runners (\\~$600) An amazing fellow Wedditor offered to make cheesecloth table runners for me at cost. It came out to around $320 for 20 17 ft. white cheesecloth runners (around $1/ft). I wanted a clean tablescape with white linens, white runner and greenery down the table. These added a soft ethereal look to the table while staying minimalistic. I was also going to buy linens and napkins online. \n\n\\- Compostable Plates ($450)  Estimate for compostable dinner plate, salad plate, dessert plate, and family style platters for the table. \n\n\\- Smoking Gun Bartending ($676.75)  Found these guys on Thumbtack and so glad I did! This was for 2 bartenders and 1 bar back ($20/hr per staff). Price also included ice for the whole night, 2 mobile bar setups and coffee service and equipment. Even though we only paid for coffee for 150 people, they were going to bring enough cups for 220 to use for coffee and tea.\n\n\\- Cups/Mixers/Alcohol ($2300)  We were going to do wine, beer, and limited liquor (whiskey, gin, vodka) with a  couple signature cocktails and mixers for basic cocktails. Cups I priced out through Amazon and were a combination of  plastic 12 oz cups for beer, small 9 oz cups for cocktails and water, plus 12 oz stemless wine glasses.\n\n\\- Whole Foods Cake ($300)   I did the traditional cake tasting and it was so fun to try cool, unique flavors, but after getting a $665 quote, we decided that desserts were low priority for us. We were planning to do 3 round cakes on a tiered cake stand, plus some extra half sheets to serve. \n\n\\- Si Paletas cart ($400)  I am MOST sad about this!! I was excited to use the money we saved on cake to have boozy popsicles served during cocktail hour from a paletas cart. I think it would have been a really fun addition to a summer wedding. \n\n\\- Welcome Happy Hour ($500)  We were going to host a welcome happy hour from 4-7 PM the Friday before the wedding. We provided some food and drinks to start things off, but made it clear on our website that additional drinks &amp; food can be purchased with happy hour pricing. \n\n**Photography/Videography (9.5%) - $3800**\n\n**-** River Medlock Photography ($3000)  Photography was our #2 priority and budgeted $3-4K for photography. However, with the tea ceremony in the morning, we needed 10 hours of photography and found the going rate for 10 hours was $4500-$6K.  Luckily, I found Jana + Jamie of River Medlock Photography through A Practical Wedding and I loved their work. For SoCal weddings, they offer a flat $3k package for full day coverage (12 hours max). *Still deciding what we want to do about this vendor. Ideally, I'd love for them to still photograph our future celebration, but if not, we will forfeit the $600 deposit.* \n\n\\- Last Light Pictures videography ($800)   We found Last Light Pictures through a recommendation on Reddit and they offered a raw footage package for $600, plus guest interviews for $200. *We didn't have to pay a deposit for LLP so we just cancelled our contract with them.* \n\n**Stationary/Paper Goods (1.13%) - $452**\n\n**-** Paperless Post Save the Dates ($50)  Did digital STDs but I accidentally picked a layout that cost coins. Didn't realize it until I was finished designing and inputting addresses, and was too lazy to go back and redesign a free one. The $50 was my lazy tax.\n\n\\- Invitation Design ($99)  Bought a custom watercolor logo for our wedding suite ($50). We incorporated the heart shaped rock by Land's End in SF (the location where we got engaged), a California poppy (husband's CA roots), a lotus (my Vietnamese heritage) and our cat. I also had her do a rendering of our wedding venue ($49). We used the logo on all our paper goods and designed on Canva.\n\n\\- Invitations ( \\~$195)  We printed invites in Vietnam and got 180 envelopes with our return address on them, 2-sided invite cards, a 1-sided details card, and a 1-sided invite card for our Catholic ceremony (smaller, separate ceremony). I paid \\~$60 for the deposit and then my mom ended up paying the rest when she picked it up. Cost is an estimate because of conversion rates. Price also includes 200 paper boxes which we put chocolates in and laid at each place setting for favors. It was unnecessary, but the boxes cost $6 total and my mom really wanted it, so we let her handle it.\n\n\\- Postage ($0)  I took stamps from work and expensed some more so we paid $0 for postage. Unethical? Maybe. But the company that just acquired us closed our SF office and require us to work from home 100% without reimbursing us for any internet or phone costs, so I consider this part of my benefits package.\n\n\\- Website ($72)  made the mistake of using Squarespace before trying any of the free websites. I just loved how much control you had over the website and could not go back, so we ended up just purchasing a year hosting and custom domain. My husband works for a university so we got the education discount.\n\n\\- Signage ($120) Planned to print a welcome sign and seating chart on Vistaprint for about $20 each. My friend had given me a nice frame from her wedding, which we used for the welcome sign, and we were going to buy another poster frame for $10 for the seating chart. Michael's at easels for sale for $12 each.\n\n\\- Other paper goods ($50)  Was going to design the programs (bilingual wedding, programs were necessary), menu and bar signs on Canva. Staples sells cardstock for $50. \n\n**Entertainment (3.5%) - $1387.96**\n\n\\- Bouquet Sound DJ  ($1095)  By the time we got to picking a DJ, we were pretty decision fatigued. Bouquet Sound played at my friend's wedding and we enjoyed it, so I reached out to them.The owner  offered us a referral rate, which we were able to negotiate down a little further. This was for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception music. *Original package was $1495, he offered us a referral rate of $1295, and I negotiated a little further by expressing that we wanted to go with them but my budget was $1k. He brought it down to $1095 if we were able to pay the deposit same day. We will forfeit the deposit but still need to contact them about it.* \n\n\\- Photobooth ($450) Was planning to DIY a photo station but ended up finding DJ Michael Han based on Reddit referrals. We booked his photobooth for 4 hours, 6 X 8 strips and digital gallery for $350. Super reasonable prices, especially compared to the $700+ rates I was getting from other vendors. Planned to spend another $100 to get life size cardboard cut outs of me, my husband, and our cat Ben Kenobi for props.*Paid a $100 deposit which he gave back.* \n\n\\- Giant Jenga &amp; various games ($40)  Bought giant Jenga on Black Friday as a lawn game for some additional entertainment. So, I guess I now have Giant Jenga. \n\n**Day of Coordinator (4.5%)  $1800**\n\nMy coordinator was Tiffany at Modest Magnolia. She is very experienced with weddings and you could tell from the first conversation with her. Though she was only a DOC, I was in contact with her throughout my entire planning process and she reached out to me in January for my June wedding with a wedding planning worksheet so she can get started on working on my timeline.. *Her going rate is $2k, but I was able to negotiate a $200 discount for offering to pay upfront. I'm trying to see if I can transfer my rate to someone who might be looking for a coordinator. Otherwise we'll forfeit the deposit.* \n\n**Flowers &amp;Decor (0.58%)  $230** I'm solidly in the camp of \"no one cares about decor\" so we kept it very minimal. i think the brick walls and greenery of the venue were gorgeous on their own, so we let the place mostly speak for itself and just bought a few things to fill up the tables.\n\nFlowers  My mom was going to pay for and make all our flowers so luckily we didn't have to deal with a floral deposit! \n\nCenterpieces ($0)  My cousin got married in Vietnam and she had 12 wood lantern displays with fake flowers and candles in them lining her ceremony aisle. She offered them to me after the wedding and we were going to repurpose into centerpieces. My best friend is getting married in April so she's going to use these instead, so I'm glad they are still getting put to use! \n\nCandles, vases, table numbers (\\~$230)  Bought gold vases and mercury votives off my friend for $80, plus a ton more led candles and votives on FB marketplace. Also planned to buy wood block table numbers on Etsy to tie in with the wood centerpieces, so this is budgeted in here too. \n\n**Hair and Makeup - $1212**\n\n\\- Studio MM&amp;B Includes hair and makeup for bride ($480) and trial ($250). I also paid for my mom's hair and makeup ($190) plus 50% of any services that my bridal party wanted (another $292). Studio MM&amp;B was great, super professional and talented artists, but they definitely have the prices to reflect that. *I paid for this deposit maybe 3 weeks before the world blew up, so really regretting this one. It's non-refundable though, so what can you do.* \n\n**Wedding Party Gifts/Attire - $1200** In lieu of presents, we paid for our wedding party's attire. It was definitely more money than if we just bought them small presents, but 3 out of my 5 bridesmaids are in grad school/medical residencies and I knew that the most thoughtful present would be to help with the cost of being in the wedding. My bridesmaids wore midi length sage green dresses from Fame&amp;Partners and City Chic, and their dresses ranged from $100-$139. For groomsmen, we were going to pay for the suit rental (jacket&amp;pant) from Generation Tux at $139 each. \n\n**Transportation costs - $1592.50**\n\n\\ - Riz Transportation shuttle service ($580)  Price is for 5 hours, inclusive of tax and gratuity. I booked the shuttle to transport the groom's family + wedding party from LA to my parent's house for our tea ceremony (a 20-30 minute drive). We could have let people figure this out themselves, but I wanted to keep the group on time and keep people from needing to rent a car just to get to the tea ceremony.*Just emailed him today about our deposit, so still waiting to hear back.*\n\n\\- Valet parking ($1012.50)  The rate was $135/hr for 25 cars. The vendor requires that you book them for an hour before your event starts up to 30 minutes after the end time (7.5 hours). This was a painful expense, but parking in the Arts District can be hit or miss and I was already  throwing my traditional Vietnamese family for a loop with my warehouse wedding. So we paid for parking, which was organized and invoiced by our venue. *Luckily this was going to be handled through the venue so we didn't have to put any money down.* \n\n**Tips - $1000** What I had budgeted for tips \n\n**Additional Spending Not included in Budget - $5760** Basically our attire and wedding rings, which we paid for through our regular paychecks and not the savings account. I didn't really consider these part of the wedding budget because they are going to last us past the wedding day, but wanted to include the breakdown for transparency.\n\n**-** Groom's suit ($500)  My husband got a custom 2-piece suit made in Vietnam at a tailor we've used before. He could definitely get a suit in Asia for far less but this shop stocks high quality fabrics and does all of their tailoring in-house so it's still a bargain for the price point.\n\n\\- Wedding Dress ($2500)  I bought the A La Robe Juliette in blush at The Dress Theory in Seattle. It's a simple slip dress and it was just a perfect fit for my style. The soft pink color and deep low back felt rebellious and fashion forward, but also it was minimal and comfy AF. *I'm currently debating if I want to keep this or just resell it to get some money back from this wedding. I do still love it and it has rewearability potential though, so I'm back and forth.* \n\n\\- Wedding Headpiece ($690) I bought a Jennifer Behr headpiece off Poshmark impulsively. This was a ridiculous purchase but I loved it. *Hoping to be able to resell or give to a friend to use for any upcoming weddings.*\n\n\\- Alterations ($410) This was the estimate for alterations. My dress is currently sitting with them and my first fitting was supposed to be end of April. Unsure now if they'll be open then, but I didn't have to put any money down so this was money not yet spent. \n\n\\- Wedding Rings ($1660) My husband got a 6.5 mm gold comfort fit band for $820. I got two wedding bands off an online retailer,Noemie, for $840 total.

I know this is a ton of money (as much as some people's whole weddings) and it was definitely not an easy decision to walk away from. However, the big wedding just no longer felt like something we wanted after going through this tough year (Covid on top of other personal stuff), and I'm big on not letting the \"Cost Sunk Fallacy\" drive your decisions. By walking away from $10k, we will have saved $30K. It actually worked out well because I'm now at risk for getting furloughed, so the extra savings is an extreme blessing during these shaky times! \n\nAnd a final plug - if anyone is interested in any of these vendors, I may be able to discuss transferring my contract and payments to you.

We don&amp;#39;t plan to have the same big party, and are instead hoping to get married as soon as City Hall opens back up for us to get a license, and doing a smaller Catholic ceremony/reception once this is all over. As a final farewell to the would-be wedding, I wanted to still post a budget recap as we had taken a lot of effort to budget for everything needed. Some of this stuff is obviously an estimation as it would have depended on our final numbers, but this was our general estimates based on 220 guests. Wish I could have written this with photos to share, but I still hope it offers some clarity for couples planning a big wedding in a HCOL area. I included comments on my negotiations as well as how cancellation worked with these vendors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Cost of the Wedding: ~$45K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our financial contribution: $40K&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;#39;s financial contribution: $5K wedding gift, plus floral costs/labor and other expenses picked up here and there&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Additional spending not included in budget (rings, outfits, alterations): $5760&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Total value of discounts and negotiations: ~$4200&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***Total value of wedding if you included discounts and additional spending: ~$54,960&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venue &amp;amp; Insurance - $6500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Seventh/Place venue ($6500)  Venue was going to be the Seventh/Place in DTLA. It&amp;#39;s a renovated warehouse space that fit our large guest count, had a lovely outdoor patio, had a 16 hour rental period and included tables and chairs as part of the rental price. Pricing also came with uplights lining the walls,string lights across the ceiling, and 2 security guards. It was a really simple but romantic space, and felt very us.  They also had a full open vendor policy (except for florals and valet) so we could really shop around and find solutions to fit our budget. &lt;em&gt;Price was originally $7150, negotiated a $650 discount for paying upfront. They have a Force Majeure clause and I requested 100% of our payment back on Friday. Still waiting to hear back from them but this is one I intend to fight tooth and nail for.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Beverage - $24,894.03&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://www.hungrybearcatering.com/\"&gt;Hungry Bear Catering&lt;/a&gt; (Would have been $18007.28, we paid a $7946 deposit)  Food was my #1 priority and going to be the biggest expense. Most traditional caterers were priced pretty similarly with more &amp;#39;meh&amp;#39; food, and if I was going to spend thousands on catering, I wanted it to be memorable. This price includes 3 passed apps (tofu baos, crab cakes, beef tataki) and a family style meal of bread/butter/furikake chex mix on the table, 1 salad course, 2 mains (filet mignon and miso salmon), and 2 sides (fish glazed brussel sprouts and miso carbonara). Anyone with dietary restrictions got their own meal, as did kids. They also provided cake cutting, 3 welcome drinks, and coffee/tea service in this price. Price does not include equipment which we had to rent separately. &lt;em&gt;Their base price is usually $80/person before tax and service charges, but we were able to negotiate down to $66.50/person without removing any services. Per the contract we would have gotten 50% of the deposit back for cancellation, but we decided to have them keep the cost and are working with them to donate meals to a food bank instead&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- MTB Event Rentals ($2300)  Estimate for bring in glassware, serving ware for the tables, and a full kitchen setup. MTB had the most reasonable prices and were great to work with. &lt;em&gt;We were able to cancel and get 100% of our deposit back.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Linens/Table Runners (~$600) An amazing fellow Wedditor offered to make cheesecloth table runners for me at cost. It came out to around $320 for 20 17 ft. white cheesecloth runners (around $1/ft). I wanted a clean tablescape with white linens, white runner and greenery down the table. These added a soft ethereal look to the table while staying minimalistic. I was also going to buy linens and napkins online. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Compostable Plates ($450)  Estimate for compostable dinner plate, salad plate, dessert plate, and family style platters for the table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Smoking Gun Bartending ($676.75)  Found these guys on Thumbtack and so glad I did! This was for 2 bartenders and 1 bar back ($20/hr per staff). Price also included ice for the whole night, 2 mobile bar setups and coffee service and equipment. Even though we only paid for coffee for 150 people, they were going to bring enough cups for 220 to use for coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Cups/Mixers/Alcohol ($2300)  We were going to do wine, beer, and limited liquor (whiskey, gin, vodka) with a  couple signature cocktails and mixers for basic cocktails. Cups I priced out through Amazon and were a combination of  plastic 12 oz cups for beer, small 9 oz cups for cocktails and water, plus 12 oz stemless wine glasses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Whole Foods Cake ($300)   I did the traditional cake tasting and it was so fun to try cool, unique flavors, but after getting a $665 quote, we decided that desserts were low priority for us. We were planning to do 3 round cakes on a tiered cake stand, plus some extra half sheets to serve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Si Paletas cart ($400)  I am MOST sad about this!! I was excited to use the money we saved on cake to have boozy popsicles served during cocktail hour from a paletas cart. I think it would have been a really fun addition to a summer wedding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Welcome Happy Hour ($500)  We were going to host a welcome happy hour from 4-7 PM the Friday before the wedding. We provided some food and drinks to start things off, but made it clear on our website that additional drinks &amp;amp; food can be purchased with happy hour pricing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography/Videography (9.5%) - $3800&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; River Medlock Photography ($3000)  Photography was our #2 priority and budgeted $3-4K for photography. However, with the tea ceremony in the morning, we needed 10 hours of photography and found the going rate for 10 hours was $4500-$6K.  Luckily, I found Jana + Jamie of River Medlock Photography through A Practical Wedding and I loved their work. For SoCal weddings, they offer a flat $3k package for full day coverage (12 hours max). &lt;em&gt;Still deciding what we want to do about this vendor. Ideally, I&amp;#39;d love for them to still photograph our future celebration, but if not, we will forfeit the $600 deposit.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Last Light Pictures videography ($800)   We found Last Light Pictures through a recommendation on Reddit and they offered a raw footage package for $600, plus guest interviews for $200. &lt;em&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t have to pay a deposit for LLP so we just cancelled our contract with them.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stationary/Paper Goods (1.13%) - $452&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Paperless Post Save the Dates ($50)  Did digital STDs but I accidentally picked a layout that cost coins. Didn&amp;#39;t realize it until I was finished designing and inputting addresses, and was too lazy to go back and redesign a free one. The $50 was my lazy tax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Invitation Design ($99)  Bought a custom watercolor logo for our wedding suite ($50). We incorporated the heart shaped rock by Land&amp;#39;s End in SF (the location where we got engaged), a California poppy (husband&amp;#39;s CA roots), a lotus (my Vietnamese heritage) and our cat. I also had her do a rendering of our wedding venue ($49). We used the logo on all our paper goods and designed on Canva.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Invitations ( ~$195)  We printed invites in Vietnam and got 180 envelopes with our return address on them, 2-sided invite cards, a 1-sided details card, and a 1-sided invite card for our Catholic ceremony (smaller, separate ceremony). I paid ~$60 for the deposit and then my mom ended up paying the rest when she picked it up. Cost is an estimate because of conversion rates. Price also includes 200 paper boxes which we put chocolates in and laid at each place setting for favors. It was unnecessary, but the boxes cost $6 total and my mom really wanted it, so we let her handle it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Postage ($0)  I took stamps from work and expensed some more so we paid $0 for postage. Unethical? Maybe. But the company that just acquired us closed our SF office and require us to work from home 100% without reimbursing us for any internet or phone costs, so I consider this part of my benefits package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Website ($72)  made the mistake of using Squarespace before trying any of the free websites. I just loved how much control you had over the website and could not go back, so we ended up just purchasing a year hosting and custom domain. My husband works for a university so we got the education discount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Signage ($120) Planned to print a welcome sign and seating chart on Vistaprint for about $20 each. My friend had given me a nice frame from her wedding, which we used for the welcome sign, and we were going to buy another poster frame for $10 for the seating chart. Michael&amp;#39;s at easels for sale for $12 each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Other paper goods ($50)  Was going to design the programs (bilingual wedding, programs were necessary), menu and bar signs on Canva. Staples sells cardstock for $50. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entertainment (3.5%) - $1387.96&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Bouquet Sound DJ  ($1095)  By the time we got to picking a DJ, we were pretty decision fatigued. Bouquet Sound played at my friend&amp;#39;s wedding and we enjoyed it, so I reached out to them.The owner  offered us a referral rate, which we were able to negotiate down a little further. This was for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception music. &lt;em&gt;Original package was $1495, he offered us a referral rate of $1295, and I negotiated a little further by expressing that we wanted to go with them but my budget was $1k. He brought it down to $1095 if we were able to pay the deposit same day. We will forfeit the deposit but still need to contact them about it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Photobooth ($450) Was planning to DIY a photo station but ended up finding DJ Michael Han based on Reddit referrals. We booked his photobooth for 4 hours, 6 X 8 strips and digital gallery for $350. Super reasonable prices, especially compared to the $700+ rates I was getting from other vendors. Planned to spend another $100 to get life size cardboard cut outs of me, my husband, and our cat Ben Kenobi for props.&lt;em&gt;Paid a $100 deposit which he gave back.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Giant Jenga &amp;amp; various games ($40)  Bought giant Jenga on Black Friday as a lawn game for some additional entertainment. So, I guess I now have Giant Jenga. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day of Coordinator (4.5%)  $1800&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My coordinator was Tiffany at Modest Magnolia. She is very experienced with weddings and you could tell from the first conversation with her. Though she was only a DOC, I was in contact with her throughout my entire planning process and she reached out to me in January for my June wedding with a wedding planning worksheet so she can get started on working on my timeline.. &lt;em&gt;Her going rate is $2k, but I was able to negotiate a $200 discount for offering to pay upfront. I&amp;#39;m trying to see if I can transfer my rate to someone who might be looking for a coordinator. Otherwise we&amp;#39;ll forfeit the deposit.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flowers &amp;amp;Decor (0.58%)  $230&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m solidly in the camp of &amp;quot;no one cares about decor&amp;quot; so we kept it very minimal. i think the brick walls and greenery of the venue were gorgeous on their own, so we let the place mostly speak for itself and just bought a few things to fill up the tables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flowers  My mom was going to pay for and make all our flowers so luckily we didn&amp;#39;t have to deal with a floral deposit! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centerpieces ($0)  My cousin got married in Vietnam and she had 12 wood lantern displays with fake flowers and candles in them lining her ceremony aisle. She offered them to me after the wedding and we were going to repurpose into centerpieces. My best friend is getting married in April so she&amp;#39;s going to use these instead, so I&amp;#39;m glad they are still getting put to use! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Candles, vases, table numbers (~$230)  Bought gold vases and mercury votives off my friend for $80, plus a ton more led candles and votives on FB marketplace. Also planned to buy wood block table numbers on Etsy to tie in with the wood centerpieces, so this is budgeted in here too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair and Makeup - $1212&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Studio MM&amp;amp;B Includes hair and makeup for bride ($480) and trial ($250). I also paid for my mom&amp;#39;s hair and makeup ($190) plus 50% of any services that my bridal party wanted (another $292). Studio MM&amp;amp;B was great, super professional and talented artists, but they definitely have the prices to reflect that. &lt;em&gt;I paid for this deposit maybe 3 weeks before the world blew up, so really regretting this one. It&amp;#39;s non-refundable though, so what can you do.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wedding Party Gifts/Attire - $1200&lt;/strong&gt; In lieu of presents, we paid for our wedding party&amp;#39;s attire. It was definitely more money than if we just bought them small presents, but 3 out of my 5 bridesmaids are in grad school/medical residencies and I knew that the most thoughtful present would be to help with the cost of being in the wedding. My bridesmaids wore midi length sage green dresses from Fame&amp;amp;Partners and City Chic, and their dresses ranged from $100-$139. For groomsmen, we were going to pay for the suit rental (jacket&amp;amp;pant) from Generation Tux at $139 each. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation costs - $1592.50&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\\ - Riz Transportation shuttle service ($580)  Price is for 5 hours, inclusive of tax and gratuity. I booked the shuttle to transport the groom&amp;#39;s family + wedding party from LA to my parent&amp;#39;s house for our tea ceremony (a 20-30 minute drive). We could have let people figure this out themselves, but I wanted to keep the group on time and keep people from needing to rent a car just to get to the tea ceremony.&lt;em&gt;Just emailed him today about our deposit, so still waiting to hear back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Valet parking ($1012.50)  The rate was $135/hr for 25 cars. The vendor requires that you book them for an hour before your event starts up to 30 minutes after the end time (7.5 hours). This was a painful expense, but parking in the Arts District can be hit or miss and I was already  throwing my traditional Vietnamese family for a loop with my warehouse wedding. So we paid for parking, which was organized and invoiced by our venue. &lt;em&gt;Luckily this was going to be handled through the venue so we didn&amp;#39;t have to put any money down.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips - $1000&lt;/strong&gt; What I had budgeted for tips &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Spending Not included in Budget - $5760&lt;/strong&gt; Basically our attire and wedding rings, which we paid for through our regular paychecks and not the savings account. I didn&amp;#39;t really consider these part of the wedding budget because they are going to last us past the wedding day, but wanted to include the breakdown for transparency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Groom&amp;#39;s suit ($500)  My husband got a custom 2-piece suit made in Vietnam at a tailor we&amp;#39;ve used before. He could definitely get a suit in Asia for far less but this shop stocks high quality fabrics and does all of their tailoring in-house so it&amp;#39;s still a bargain for the price point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Wedding Dress ($2500)  I bought the A La Robe Juliette in blush at The Dress Theory in Seattle. It&amp;#39;s a simple slip dress and it was just a perfect fit for my style. The soft pink color and deep low back felt rebellious and fashion forward, but also it was minimal and comfy AF. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently debating if I want to keep this or just resell it to get some money back from this wedding. I do still love it and it has rewearability potential though, so I&amp;#39;m back and forth.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Wedding Headpiece ($690) I bought a Jennifer Behr headpiece off Poshmark impulsively. This was a ridiculous purchase but I loved it. &lt;em&gt;Hoping to be able to resell or give to a friend to use for any upcoming weddings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Alterations ($410) This was the estimate for alterations. My dress is currently sitting with them and my first fitting was supposed to be end of April. Unsure now if they&amp;#39;ll be open then, but I didn&amp;#39;t have to put any money down so this was money not yet spent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Wedding Rings ($1660) My husband got a 6.5 mm gold comfort fit band for $820. I got two wedding bands off an online retailer,Noemie, for $840 total. My engagement ring was passed down from my MIL and we didn&amp;#39;t make any changes to it, so it was $0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, we probably stand to forfeit ~$10k in lost deposits, though we *could* have gotten more back from our caterer. I know this is a ton of money (as much as some people&amp;#39;s whole weddings) and it was definitely not an easy decision to walk away from. However, the big wedding just no longer felt like something we wanted after going through this tough year (Covid on top of other personal stuff), and I&amp;#39;m big on not letting the &amp;quot;Cost Sunk Fallacy&amp;quot; drive your decisions. By walking away from $10k, we will have saved $30K. It actually worked out well because I&amp;#39;m now at risk for getting furloughed, so the extra savings is an extreme blessing during these shaky times! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a final plug - if anyone is interested in any of these vendors, I may be able to discuss transferring my contract and payments to you.

We did everything that WE wanted to do. We did not do anything or make any significant choices based on our guests. We wanted a fast ceremony and a laid back reception and that's exactly what we did. No first dances, cake cutting, garter toss, dancing. Just lunch and ice cream (which our guests LOVED since it was 80 degrees). \n2. Chose easy decorations since we were setting everything up ourselves. We gave ourselves 4 days before the wedding to get all the last minute stuff together (cutting our menu's, folding napkins, bagging snacks) and then 4 hours before the ceremony to set up all tables, chairs, decor, desserts, drinks, ceremony seats EVERYTHING. We were right on schedule with all the help\n3. Have someone you know be your officiant. My sister was ours and literally everyone complemented it and mentioned how cool it was.\n4. DIY is ALOT. While it was great and all, I had major decision fatigue. Set someone you trust to make some of the small decisions for you.\n5. If you want to DIY, buy a font package off etsy or wherever and use that font for everything. It is an easy way to tie in all signage. \n6. Having a 1:15 ceremony was a LIFESAVER. I was so tired by the time the guest left I couldn't imagine how tired I would have been if we chose to do a later time. If you aren't into the whole dance party scene, a afternoon reception is the way to go.\n7. I did my own hair and make up. It took time, but not even nearly as long as if someone else did it for me. I used basically the same makeup I use every day and just curled my hair into a pony tail. Not looking for anything fancy and I liked how I looked like myself, just better?\n\nEverything was absolutely perfect and went just how I wanted. I can't imagine planning a wedding if I did not have 5+ years in the event industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that was weird was my MIL handed me a gift bag and said \"this is for tonight\" and it was full of lingerie.....AWKWARD",

My wedding is on June 1, so I'm about a week and a half out, and my anxiety is off the charts to the point that I'm not even really looking forward to it. I'm starting to feel totally disconnected from my fianc\u00e9 and from this whole process and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nIt's not so much about getting everything done or having it be perfect. To be honest, most wedding stuff I don't even really care that much about, which creates a different problem: I have total decision fatigue from having to make decisions about things that I have no actual opinion about. I'm the first in my generation to get married in my family, so my wedding is a Big Deal and I'm touched that everyone is so excited but honestly I'm so, so tired of it all. Because it's the first one, none of us (mom, grandma, etc) really know what we're doing and I'm not really enjoying being a trailblazer. I'm pretty shy, so all the \"princess for a day, all eyes on you\" stuff is turning me into a nervous wreck. Plus, both of our families live in the northeast but we live in Seattle and are getting married out here, so we've had to do everything completely on our own. My parents are divorced and my mom's family keeps forgetting my dad's family exists. The other day my brother got frustrated with me because of some miscommunication about what the men were supposed to wear and I completely melted down - I don't even care what the men wear or if they match or anything! But I really care about being a good host and doing right by my loved ones, and I am starting to take it really hard if I feel like I'm messing something up or committing some kind of faux pas.\n\nOn top of all this, I am a lawyer and until recently worked as the assistant director of a really, really small nonprofit organization. In December of last year, my amazing boss decided to leave, and in response, our board (totally unexpectedly) decided to dissolve the organization rather than hire a new Executive Director. So I spent January-April of this year as the sole staff member doing essentially end-of-life care for an organization that I've put my whole heart into for the last two years, and now I'm going into my wedding unemployed after having lost my job in one of the most painful ways I can imagine. Plus my old boss is on a trip around the world and isn't even coming to the wedding.\n\nI am totally frayed and so, so tired and I feel like I have nothing left. I am honestly kind of dreading the wedding at this point, and I feel horrible for feeling that way. But I'm at the point where I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can knit and read Game of Thrones and never talk to anybody else ever again. Can anyone relate to this or am I just the world's worst bride?\n\nEDIT thanks for the comments everyone, they actually really made me feel better. I think there's so much social pressure for your wedding to be THE GREATEST AND MOST MAGICAL EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE that if it doesn't feel that way it can feel like you're doing something wrong. I'm glad we're having this conversation, though - seems like a lot of us can relate to the feeling that everything in the world sucks balls!",

To be honest, most wedding stuff I don&amp;#39;t even really care that much about, which creates a different problem: I have total decision fatigue from having to make decisions about things that I have no actual opinion about. I&amp;#39;m the first in my generation to get married in my family, so my wedding is a Big Deal and I&amp;#39;m touched that everyone is so excited but honestly I&amp;#39;m so, so tired of it all. Because it&amp;#39;s the first one, none of us (mom, grandma, etc) really know what we&amp;#39;re doing and I&amp;#39;m not really enjoying being a trailblazer. I&amp;#39;m pretty shy, so all the &amp;quot;princess for a day, all eyes on you&amp;quot; stuff is turning me into a nervous wreck. Plus, both of our families live in the northeast but we live in Seattle and are getting married out here, so we&amp;#39;ve had to do everything completely on our own. My parents are divorced and my mom&amp;#39;s family keeps forgetting my dad&amp;#39;s family exists. The other day my brother got frustrated with me because of some miscommunication about what the men were supposed to wear and I completely melted down - I don&amp;#39;t even care what the men wear or if they match or anything! But I really care about being a good host and doing right by my loved ones, and I am starting to take it really hard if I feel like I&amp;#39;m messing something up or committing some kind of faux pas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, I am a lawyer and until recently worked as the assistant director of a really, really small nonprofit organization. In December of last year, my amazing boss decided to leave, and in response, our board (totally unexpectedly) decided to dissolve the organization rather than hire a new Executive Director. So I spent January-April of this year as the sole staff member doing essentially end-of-life care for an organization that I&amp;#39;ve put my whole heart into for the last two years, and now I&amp;#39;m going into my wedding unemployed after having lost my job in one of the most painful ways I can imagine. Plus my old boss is on a trip around the world and isn&amp;#39;t even coming to the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am totally frayed and so, so tired and I feel like I have nothing left. I am honestly kind of dreading the wedding at this point, and I feel horrible for feeling that way. But I&amp;#39;m at the point where I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can knit and read Game of Thrones and never talk to anybody else ever again. Can anyone relate to this or am I just the world&amp;#39;s worst bride?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT thanks for the comments everyone, they actually really made me feel better. I think there&amp;#39;s so much social pressure for your wedding to be THE GREATEST AND MOST MAGICAL EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE that if it doesn&amp;#39;t feel that way it can feel like you&amp;#39;re doing something wrong. I&amp;#39;m glad we&amp;#39;re having this conversation, though - seems like a lot of us can relate to the feeling that everything in the world sucks balls!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Posts from couples on the other side were SO helpful to me when planning, so I wanted to share some of the things I've been reflecting on since our 10/27 wedding.\n\n**Things I'm So Glad We Did:**\n\n1. **Book the Weird Venue:** We got married on a boat! A kind of ugly one, if I'm being honest. Everyone loved it. For a long time I regretted not choosing the pinterest-worthy estate, but honestly the weird venue was perfectly weird for us.\n2. **Make Time for The Two of Us:** Our first look was about 2 hours before our ceremony. We used the gap to go on a mini adventure with our photographer and say some private vows (and go to McDonalds). After the ceremony, we hid for a few minutes to enjoy being married and eat appetizers. And we walked by ourselves to our after-party. I'm an introvert, and it was so nice to have some dedicated alone time with my husband. Even if you don't do a first look, find a way to sneak off for some alone time during the reception.\n3. **Have an Uneven Wedding Party:** My husband has a huge group of close friends. I don't really have any friends. He had five groomsmen on his side, and I just had my brother. I was worried, but it was fine! The best man and my brother stood up during the ceremony; the other groomsmen processed in, then sat in the first row. And the groomsmen were kind and thoughtful, adopting me as one of their tribe when I needed anything throughout the day.\n4. **Hire the Right Vendors:** Our photographer, Adam, is now a good friend, and felt more like a guest than a vendor. Our caterer and the bakery who made our cupcakes left everyone stuffed and happy. Our venue coordinator got our vision and helped us achieve it seamlessly. We hired people we clicked with, even when they seemed a little off-beat, or weren't the cheapest. It worked for us.\n5. **Have a Friend Officiate:** Having someone who was important to us, and who had played an important role in our early relationship, made the ceremony meaningful to us.\n6. **Include Details That Were Special to Us:** I hand-painted custom Funko Pop! figures of us in our wedding outfits. We brought special chairs into the venue for the sweetheart table. We named our signature drinks after our pets, and had cardboard cutouts of them at the bar. We had a memorial table with our grandparents' wedding photos.\n\n**Things We Could Have Skipped:** \n\n1. **Pretty Much Every Other Detail:** My fiance photoshopped all of our signage and it was awesome. We gave out sunglasses for our outdoor ceremony, glow sticks for our exit, and our favorite snacks as take-aways. All of that stuff was really fun to put together! But it was also added stress the week of the wedding, and made clean up and set up more involved.\n2. **Flowers:** My mom really wanted us to have floral centerpieces, and we had decision fatigue so we let her run wild. The flowers looked great, but I did not even look at the centerpieces. I wanted a bouquet, but in hindsight I could have lived without it.\n3. **Visiting Each Table at Dinner:** Our wedding had about 60 people total. We were able to catch every guest during cocktail hour/dancing. We visited tables as extra assurance, but we didn't need to worry about catching everyone.\n\n**Things That Went \"Wrong\", But Didn't Matter At All:**\n\n1. It rained for most of the day.\n2. It was too muddy to wear my wedding shoes. I had to wear my combat boots to have some tread.\n3. We both forgot to hand-write our vows and had to pull out our phones during the ceremony.\n4. We didn't get the lavalier microphones I really wanted for the ceremony and had to use a hand-held mic.\n5. The groomsmen forgot to bring my brother his matching wedding-party tie. He went without a tie and looked great.\n6. My mom bought a guestbook and set it up without asking us (we had already purchased one). I just put it out of the way before the wedding started.\n7. Two of my half-siblings RSVP'd no because we had a child-free wedding.\n8. One of our signature cocktails was slightly different than we'd requested.\n9. We didn't make reservations for our after-party and had to try a couple of different bars.\n\nPhoto Tax: [https://adammason.com/fall-cherry-blossom-riverboat-wedding/](https://adammason.com/fall-cherry-blossom-riverboat-wedding/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&lt;3 Weddit.",

I am SO thankful to all of you wonderful people on this sub - for all your inspiration, support, advice. You guys are amazing and I don't think I could have pulled it off without you!\n\nI'll start with my memories/takeaways from the day, give y'all a budget breakdown, and pics at the end! Sorry in advance for the Wall O' Text! ;)\n\nMy morning began when 18 month old daughter decided it was time to get me out of bed at 6:30. It felt so surreal. I looked out the window and it was the most gorgeous, perfect, sunny morning. Outdoor wedding and we hit the weather jackpot! So lucky. \n\nI was a HUGE bundle of nerves. My husband (AHHHH this still sounds so weird) left early that morning to take care of some food items (we self-catered) and go work out. We spent the morning packing the car with tablecloths, decorations, my huge dress that almost didn't fit. I couldn't eat anything and was honestly kind of a nervous wreck. It took forever to get everything together and in hindsight, I definitely should have packed the car the night before.\n\nMy mom drove me and my daughter and all our decor to the venue, which was a summer camp in the woods about 40 minutes out of town. I was soooo nauseous and anxious. I threw up in the car! I definitely did not expect such a strong reaction from myself, but I was definitely just feeling the gravity of the situation and the pressure to bring it all together. Still really excited to marry my man, I never doubted that, but was just super anxious about it all going well and standing in front of so many people.\n\nArrived, my cousin started on my makeup and all my bridesmaids were already there and getting ready. It felt good to be surrounded by my girls but I was still a basket case. I had two blueberries for lunch and got into my dress. It was almost time for our first look.\n\nEVERYTHING melted away when I saw my (future) husband. All the anxiety and worries and negative emotions were just instantly gone. He was so handsome in his tux and everything was suddenly right with the world. He held back tears and I held back tears and it was just beautiful. He loved my dress which was something I had been concerned about for months. We took lots of pictures and then headed off with our wedding party to take pictures before the ceremony by a lake on the property. Everything was so much fun and we laughed and were silly and just had a great time until it was time for the ceremony to start.\n\nEverything felt very serious walking down the aisle. I was so happy, but just really felt how important these next few moments were going to be. I really felt the power of the situation all morning and afternoon leading up to the ceremony. It ended up being so beautiful. Our officiant was AMAZING and prepared the most wonderful message, perfectly tailored to us. It was so touching. My stepfather did a reading I had prepared from Carl Sagan and it was so beautiful. One funny moment is that as I was walking down the aisle with my parents - everything is outside, mind you - some kind of bug or insect crawled or flew up my dress and decided to make a home on my legs. It was so hilarious and kinda distracting as I tried to encourage it to go away as I stood up there with my man. I didn't think to use any bug spray! Oops. Anyway, as we were saying our vows, everyone and everything else (including that bug) vanished from my world and it was just me and him. Nothing has ever felt more right. I managed to hold back my tears as did he, but pretty much everyone in the crowd was weepy. Significant, touching ceremony, accomplished! I can't wait to get back our video!\n\nThe day feels like a whirlwhind from here. We ran off into the woods for about ten minutes just the two of us to take it all in. Beaming and happy. The reception was awesome! All our special people gathered together and having a great time. I couldn't walk three steps without being stopped by another guest for conversation, and I'm so thankful for friends that brought me food and drinks! It was sunny and gorgeous, the venue was decorated PERFECTLY by my sweet family and wedding planner, we had a great musician playing for dinner. It was very casual and folks roamed around and ate from the buffet as they got hungry. We cut the cake and my husband (!!) gave a beautiful impromptu speech. I actually sat down and ate! My husband and his uncle cooked all the food and it was absolutely divine. Pulled pork barbeque from a local farm, amazing salad greens from another local farmer, all kinds of yummy sides - crab stuffed jalapenos, delicious mushrooms marinated in wine, pickled onions that were to die for, fresh strawberries that were a wedding gift from another one of our farmer friends. Lots of fresh and local food, which is our passion.\n\nAs dinner wound up and the second band was about to start up in the pavilion where our ceremony was held, everyone ran off and changed into their dancing clothes. The rest of the night was spent barefoot on that dance floor, feeling joyful and grateful and full of wonder that we dreamed up this amazing party and pulled it off without a hitch. One of my bridesmaids remarked that she felt like she was in a romantic movie and she was completely right. It was just perfect beyond belief. Everything ran so smoothly, we had plenty of food and drink. We even did a self-serve open bar (beer and wine only though) and the only person that got too drunk was my cousin that had been drinking out of his own personal bottle of whiskey. He was still pleasant and happy and his sister took him home before he got into trouble. So literally zero issues! This was something I had been worried about when we decided not to have a bartender. Thank goodness all our friends and family are mature adults that can handle their booze! \n\nWe had the band leave one of their PA speakers after they broke down and we started a Spotify playlist we had prepared for the wedding. Some of the guys built a fire in the big fireplace on the other side of the pavilion and there was tons of good conversation and my ladies and I would flit back and forth from the fire to the dance floor. I think we danced until 2am. We then went traipsing through the woods with our flashlights to explore and we found a giant tube slide in the woods. Oh yeah, right, we are at a kids' summer camp! Queue about an hour of gleeful drunken squealing and laughter as we all ride the slide, beer glasses still in hand, and then RUN back up the side of this hill to do it all over again. I haven't felt childlike excitement like that in so long and we all laughed and smiled so much that our faces hurt.\n\nAt some point, somebody went back to the kitchen and brought out all the leftovers, which we all ate with our hands straight out of the storage containers. It was funny and appropriate. Everyone really just let go and enjoyed themselves and nobody took themselves too seriously. The whole vibe of the day was relaxed, easygoing, happy.\n\nMy husband and I retired at about 3am to one of the 8 cabins we had at our disposal. I think the party still went on until daylight.\n\nIt was the longest, most beautiful, amazing, significant day of my life. I am so glad we found a venue where we could spend the night and really have quality time with our friends.\n\n\n**BUDGET BREAKDOWN** (~100 guests)\n\n*Food* - $1200\nBBQ dinner with lots of sides, bread, salad, 2 tier bride's cake, groom's cake, 4 dozen cupcakes. Almost everything was from local farms and bakeries. We saved a TON of money purchasing and cooking everything ourselves. It was hard but worth it.\n\n*Alcohol* - $650 (and an additional $500 deposit on the kegs, but I am not counting that as we got it refunded)\n\n2 Kegs - Stella Artois and Abita Purple Haze\n\n12 boxes of wine, 1/2 chardonnay and 1/2 pinot noir. We purchased them at a local liquor store that runs a 20% off wine Wednesdays deal. I estimated our alcohol needs with [this](http://apracticalwedding.com/2013/01/calculate-alcohol-for-wedding/) SUPER HANDY article from APW. We had more than enough. We are still drinking leftover wine.\n\n*Rentals* - $1100\n16 round tables, 6 rectangle serving tables, 120 white chairs, a bunch of straw bales for extra seating.\n\n(The chairs were used for the ceremony and then carried over to the reception - this made me nervous but ended up being a non-issue. Groomsmen and volunteers took care of it right after the ceremony and there were no problems)\n\n*Tablecloths* - $240\nWAY cheaper to buy rather than rent. Purchased from [Smarty Had a Party](http://www.smartyhadaparty.com/). I can possibly resell them and recoup some of this expense.\n\n*Flowers* - $550\n6 bouquets, 9 boutonnieres, 3 corsages, wildflowers, carrots and radishes for reception arrangements.\n\n*Officiant* - $110\n\n*Venue* - $1725\nWe had the venue from 10AM Saturday - 12PM Sunday, and the reservation included 8 cabins with 10 bunk beds in each, a big deck where we held our reception/dinner, a huge stone tabernacle/pavilion where we held the ceremony and then turned into a dance floor for the night, and tons and tons of woods and hiking trails and aforementioned slide! (which was a total surprise) They also let us borrow their golf cart to help ferry guests around.\n\n*Photography* - $1500\n\n*Videography* - $650\n\n*Stationery* - $245\n100 invitations from Etsy vendor [Inviting Moments](https://www.etsy.com/shop/InvitingMoments), Postage, and then I had to get a reprint for more invitations after our families added to the guest list.\n\n*Labor* - $111\nI paid one person for 8 hours of work to help clear tables, set up and break down, etc. I had 8 other volunteers. I am VERY lucky to have such awesome friends and family. They refused to let me pay them.\n\n*Favors* - $80\nWe grew seedlings for people to take home (different herbs like oregano, cilantro, etc), and we provided a big basket of small LED flashlights for folks that were staying the night. SUCH A GOOD IDEA. Everyone loved them and we didn't spend too much money at all. Also I have a ton of seedlings left over so now we have an herb garden!\n\n*Music* - $750\n1 singer/songwriter for dinner that played bluegrass for ~2 hours\nA large rock/pop style band that played for ~2 hours after it got dark. Both bands were comprised of friends (and my brother-in-law) so we got incredibly good deals.\n\n*Wedding bands* - $280\nMy engagement ring and the gold for my wedding band were both my grandmother's and gifts to me. I only paid to have the wedding band made and the ring sized.\nMy husband's band we bought [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3L2X5K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Amazon for $40.\n\n*Tux rental* - FREE - we used Men's Wearhouse and we got a free Groom's tux with the rental of 5 groomsmen. My in-laws put down $50 on all of the guys' tuxes to help out with the cost, though, so I guess you could say this was $250.\n\n*Bride's Attire* - $2330\n\n* Dress - $1850 (Maggie Sottero Adalee)\n\n* Alterations - $400\n\n* \"Sticky\" backless/strapless bra - $25\n\n* Shoes - Free - wore a pair I have had for years\n\n* Jewelry - $55 necklace purchased on Etsy [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/EverblissDesigns).\n\n\n*Flower girl's dress* - $65 purchased on Etsy [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CountryCoutureCo?ref=l2-shopheader-name)\n\n*Hair/Makeup* - FREE - my cousin did both and refused payment.\n\n*Mani/Pedi &amp; eyebrow wax* - $120\n\n*Bridesmaid gifts* - $200\n\n* Raw silk clutches from Etsy vendor [Eden's Wake](https://www.etsy.com/shop/EdensWake)\n\n* Turquoise necklaces custom-made to match my own, from Etsy vendor [Everbliss Designs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/EverblissDesigns)\n\n*Groomsmen gifts* - $170\nCustom engraved [pocket knives](https://www.etsy.com/listing/187435682/set-of-6-engraved-pocket-knife-rescue?ref=shop_home_active_2) from Etsy.\n\n*Wedding Planner* - $1000 \nProvided ALL decorations (except memorial table which I did myself, and a few candles I supplied), guest book, tons of mix and match china, all the silverware, cloth napkins, serving plates and utensils, printed menus, mix and match drinking glasses, recycling bins and composting. She helped me find the venue, officiant, arranged for the rentals, was in charge of setup and breakdown and directing my volunteers to decorate the venue, kept things running smoothly and put out metaphorical fires before I knew they existed. WORTH EVERY PENNY. The peace of mind she offered was fantastic. She had tons of good ideas and tons of connections. I never would have found the perfect venue without her. We largely knew how we wanted to decorate the venue and the feel of the event and she sat back and let me plan as much or as little as I wanted to myself, and gave me discounts for it! An amazing lady to work with and I have made a new friend in the process. She's very devoted to the environment and helped me pull off a very eco-friendly, sustainable wedding.\n\nAll together, it cost about **$13,000**. My parents contributed about 1/3, my in-laws contributed about 1/3, and we paid for the rest with tax returns and savings. The only things we needed to put on a credit card was the beer and the tablecloths.\n\n**Advice/Takeaways**\n\nLet it go! Was totally my mantra throughout planning. Being able to just say \"screw it\" when I was overwhelmed with some planning detail was soooo helpful and really cut down on my stress. I got a lot of decision fatigue in the beginning from the massive amount of choices you have to make. I learned what was best for me and my sanity: just make a decision and move on. I finally learned that each element doesn't have to be the BEST POSSIBLE THING EVER, it just has to be good enough. Once I relaxed a bit and stopped spending twelve hours straight planning the perfect centerpieces, it made planning so much easier. Pick a small handful of things that are super important and focus on those, and just make quick acceptable decisions on the rest.\n\nGo with the flow on your wedding day (and in the days leading up to it). Things will come up and will not go as planned. That's okay. We had so many huge things come up in the month leading up to it. Our florist canceled with a month to go. One of our bands canceled 4 days out! Focus on solutions rather than problems and just get it done. Everything ended up being better than it would have been before. \n\nAsk for help and delegate! Trust your friends and family to help you out. Give them tasks and duties and put it out of your head. Our party was so much better because people came together and used their creativity and talent to make it work for us. My relationships are so much closer with all of these people now.\n\nTake a deep breath, take it all in, try to be in the moment as much as possible. It flies by so quickly and I'm so glad to have savored it.\n",

Purchased from &lt;a href=\"http://www.smartyhadaparty.com/\"&gt;Smarty Had a Party&lt;/a&gt;. I can possibly resell them and recoup some of this expense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flowers&lt;/em&gt; - $550\n6 bouquets, 9 boutonnieres, 3 corsages, wildflowers, carrots and radishes for reception arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Officiant&lt;/em&gt; - $110&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venue&lt;/em&gt; - $1725\nWe had the venue from 10AM Saturday - 12PM Sunday, and the reservation included 8 cabins with 10 bunk beds in each, a big deck where we held our reception/dinner, a huge stone tabernacle/pavilion where we held the ceremony and then turned into a dance floor for the night, and tons and tons of woods and hiking trails and aforementioned slide! (which was a total surprise) They also let us borrow their golf cart to help ferry guests around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography&lt;/em&gt; - $1500&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videography&lt;/em&gt; - $650&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stationery&lt;/em&gt; - $245\n100 invitations from Etsy vendor &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/InvitingMoments\"&gt;Inviting Moments&lt;/a&gt;, Postage, and then I had to get a reprint for more invitations after our families added to the guest list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labor&lt;/em&gt; - $111\nI paid one person for 8 hours of work to help clear tables, set up and break down, etc. I had 8 other volunteers. I am VERY lucky to have such awesome friends and family. They refused to let me pay them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favors&lt;/em&gt; - $80\nWe grew seedlings for people to take home (different herbs like oregano, cilantro, etc), and we provided a big basket of small LED flashlights for folks that were staying the night. SUCH A GOOD IDEA. Everyone loved them and we didn&amp;#39;t spend too much money at all. Also I have a ton of seedlings left over so now we have an herb garden!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music&lt;/em&gt; - $750\n1 singer/songwriter for dinner that played bluegrass for ~2 hours\nA large rock/pop style band that played for ~2 hours after it got dark. Both bands were comprised of friends (and my brother-in-law) so we got incredibly good deals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wedding bands&lt;/em&gt; - $280\nMy engagement ring and the gold for my wedding band were both my grandmother&amp;#39;s and gifts to me. I only paid to have the wedding band made and the ring sized.\nMy husband&amp;#39;s band we bought &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3L2X5K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for $40.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tux rental&lt;/em&gt; - FREE - we used Men&amp;#39;s Wearhouse and we got a free Groom&amp;#39;s tux with the rental of 5 groomsmen. My in-laws put down $50 on all of the guys&amp;#39; tuxes to help out with the cost, though, so I guess you could say this was $250.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bride&amp;#39;s Attire&lt;/em&gt; - $2330&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress - $1850 (Maggie Sottero Adalee)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations - $400&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sticky&amp;quot; backless/strapless bra - $25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoes - Free - wore a pair I have had for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewelry - $55 necklace purchased on Etsy &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/EverblissDesigns\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower girl&amp;#39;s dress&lt;/em&gt; - $65 purchased on Etsy &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/CountryCoutureCo?ref=l2-shopheader-name\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hair/Makeup&lt;/em&gt; - FREE - my cousin did both and refused payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mani/Pedi &amp;amp; eyebrow wax&lt;/em&gt; - $120&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridesmaid gifts&lt;/em&gt; - $200&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw silk clutches from Etsy vendor &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/EdensWake\"&gt;Eden&amp;#39;s Wake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turquoise necklaces custom-made to match my own, from Etsy vendor &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/EverblissDesigns\"&gt;Everbliss Designs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Groomsmen gifts&lt;/em&gt; - $170\nCustom engraved &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/187435682/set-of-6-engraved-pocket-knife-rescue?ref=shop_home_active_2\"&gt;pocket knives&lt;/a&gt; from Etsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wedding Planner&lt;/em&gt; - $1000 \nProvided ALL decorations (except memorial table which I did myself, and a few candles I supplied), guest book, tons of mix and match china, all the silverware, cloth napkins, serving plates and utensils, printed menus, mix and match drinking glasses, recycling bins and composting. She helped me find the venue, officiant, arranged for the rentals, was in charge of setup and breakdown and directing my volunteers to decorate the venue, kept things running smoothly and put out metaphorical fires before I knew they existed. WORTH EVERY PENNY. The peace of mind she offered was fantastic. She had tons of good ideas and tons of connections. I never would have found the perfect venue without her. We largely knew how we wanted to decorate the venue and the feel of the event and she sat back and let me plan as much or as little as I wanted to myself, and gave me discounts for it! An amazing lady to work with and I have made a new friend in the process. She&amp;#39;s very devoted to the environment and helped me pull off a very eco-friendly, sustainable wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All together, it cost about &lt;strong&gt;$13,000&lt;/strong&gt;. My parents contributed about 1/3, my in-laws contributed about 1/3, and we paid for the rest with tax returns and savings. The only things we needed to put on a credit card was the beer and the tablecloths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice/Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let it go! Was totally my mantra throughout planning. Being able to just say &amp;quot;screw it&amp;quot; when I was overwhelmed with some planning detail was soooo helpful and really cut down on my stress. I got a lot of decision fatigue in the beginning from the massive amount of choices you have to make. I learned what was best for me and my sanity: just make a decision and move on. I finally learned that each element doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the BEST POSSIBLE THING EVER, it just has to be good enough. Once I relaxed a bit and stopped spending twelve hours straight planning the perfect centerpieces, it made planning so much easier. Pick a small handful of things that are super important and focus on those, and just make quick acceptable decisions on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go with the flow on your wedding day (and in the days leading up to it). Things will come up and will not go as planned. That&amp;#39;s okay. We had so many huge things come up in the month leading up to it. Our florist canceled with a month to go. One of our bands canceled 4 days out! Focus on solutions rather than problems and just get it done. Everything ended up being better than it would have been before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask for help and delegate! Trust your friends and family to help you out. Give them tasks and duties and put it out of your head. Our party was so much better because people came together and used their creativity and talent to make it work for us. My relationships are so much closer with all of these people now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a deep breath, take it all in, try to be in the moment as much as possible. It flies by so quickly and I&amp;#39;m so glad to have savored it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Someone who will tell us if someone is sitting oddly and needs to adjust or whatever. I'd like a few more romantic shots but I don't need very artistic or dramatic photography. We love the idea of established parterned photography teams (husband-and-wife, husband-and-husband, sisters, whatever) and want someone we vibe well with. We prefer they own their own business because we want to support small businesses. FH is not a big photography fan so he wants something that looks nice for my sake but isn't very concerned about the particulars (lighting, composition, etc). He also thinks we are only going to use a handful from that day anyway over the years. \n\nPhotographer 1 (Link deleted) Has a more modular pricing scheme. So we can start at $1900, but would probably add on to get to 8 hours at least/engagement shoot to get to $2925. We actually went to college with one of them, but were more acquaintances then anything. I know at least she has been doing photography and studying photography for years. They have been doing weddings it looks like since late 2016/early 2017. Here is a full shoot of theirs. (Link deleted)\n\nPhotographer 2 (Link deleted): Flat rate for $3800 for 9 hours includes engagement shoot and all the same extras as #1. (If we did 9 hours with #1 it would be $3150.) It looks like they have been doing photography for a long time, but their wedding experience goes back to late 2015 based on their archive. Here is a full shoot of theirs.(Link deleted) You have to put in an email but it will let you in with test@gmail.com if you don't want to give it a real one. \n\n**The Dilemna** FH and I were close to set on going with Photographer 1. We met with them over Skype, we liked them. I sent links to a BM and FMIL who like them. My parents don't which kind of flamed up my own concerns. I like #1's \"featured\" photos, but I don't like every photo of theirs in the full album. Some seem a little awkward. My dad is an amateur photographer so I trusted his opinion (though I sometimes don't like his photo style so idk. Too much flash.). I find #2 who check off all of our boxes as well but are more expensive. Then I look at #2's full album, and I don't know if I see a big enough distance to justify it as well. I think they have more experience and have a better sales pitch with their blog posts, but I also didn't love every photo. \n\nWhat I am saying is I don't know if Photographer #1 is inexperienced enough that I should keep looking and/or if I'm just not going to love 100% of the shots of anyone else's wedding. I'm hitting a wall of whether I should keep researching but I am almost lost as to what I should be looking for anyway? I could really use some outside perspective, and thank you in advance for the help. &lt;3",

Happy to answer any and all questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Basic details:** 2 year engagement. The wedding was awesome and we love being married.\n\n* Invited about 130, 100 attended\n* Ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, and bonfire all at my parent's house in NH.\n* Had excellent vendors in Common Man, AshLaureen Photography (who provided any photos I share here), and KagemChic designs (for day of coordination) who were all helpful, understanding, and flexible.\n* All told, about 30k was spent between our parents and us. Some of that could have been done without/done cheaper, IMO, but it was also worth it to see family together and happy and happy for us.\n\nPriorities for us were feeding everyone a family meal (family style by Common Man was great) and feeling like this was OUR wedding.\n\n**Early planning:** We are both very close with our families and valued their input highly at this stage. Our general process went from creating a vision, confirming that would work, and then sticking to it. Once we were set in a decision, we would start to put families on information diets. They needed to know broad strokes, details would come later and we didn't want them to try to talk us out of our favorite details. Major vendors (coordination, photography, rentals, food) were locked down in the first year. I also have to give a shoutout to chotronette for my beautiful dress that made me feel like the forest nymph I've always wanted to be.\n\n**Late planning:** I definitely suffered from decision fatigue at several points in the process both caused and cured by our long engagement. I had time to focus on other things in life. I also had to adjust to trusting others to do things for me. I never wanted to burden my family, so they had to convince me that it made them happy to be involved. My parent's bathroom also broke (twice) in the summer before the wedding, so we spent a lot of weekends travelling up to their house to paint, build fences, rake the bonfire pile, landscape, make the benches, so so many things.\n\n**Day/week of:** This is where I really learned to trust people. Our coordinator was excellent in keeping everyone on the same page with expectations and timelines. Our sisters made such gorgeous design decisions, our parents handled all the major broad strokes, and everyone was committed to keep us out of stress. It was great. Really the only thing I can complain about is that we didn't have good enough speakers for the dancing playlists we created. They provided good background music, but had never been tested with bodies packed into the tent so they couldn't generate over too much talking. We still danced and had a blast, but really check this if that's what you're planning. By the time the day of rolled around though, I just so wanted to be married that everything seemed to roll off my back. I knew someone would take care of everything because we had a whole team supporting us.\n\n**Doing the backyard wedding:** At the start of the process, we thought it was going to save us money. Probably we could have done this, but we learned a lot about the tastes of our families and ourselves through the process. With some more work on our part, we probably could have saved a bit more, but not a ton. In the end, the backyard let us customize so much that it's now all anyone can talk about: the wedding felt so much like US! It was so much friggin work that I'm still kind of exhausted but it ended up being so worth it.\n\n**Budget:** Out of about 30k\n\n* 55% Food, rentals, and portable toilets\n* 7% Attire\n* 10% Decor (but it was so much more than this because of the work my parents did to spruce up the lawn and house)\n* 20% professionals (photos, coordination, paper products through minted, DIY music)\n* 4% after-party and brunch the next day\n* 4% Rehearsal dinner\n\n**Pictures:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My parents bought the benches, we put them together and rubbed them down with linseed oil.

Happy to answer any and all questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic details:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 year engagement. The wedding was awesome and we love being married.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Invited about 130, 100 attended&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, and bonfire all at my parent&amp;#39;s house in NH.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Had excellent vendors in Common Man, AshLaureen Photography (who provided any photos I share here), and KagemChic designs (for day of coordination) who were all helpful, understanding, and flexible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All told, about 30k was spent between our parents and us. Some of that could have been done without/done cheaper, IMO, but it was also worth it to see family together and happy and happy for us.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priorities for us were feeding everyone a family meal (family style by Common Man was great) and feeling like this was OUR wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early planning:&lt;/strong&gt; We are both very close with our families and valued their input highly at this stage. Our general process went from creating a vision, confirming that would work, and then sticking to it. Once we were set in a decision, we would start to put families on information diets. They needed to know broad strokes, details would come later and we didn&amp;#39;t want them to try to talk us out of our favorite details. Major vendors (coordination, photography, rentals, food) were locked down in the first year. I also have to give a shoutout to chotronette for my beautiful dress that made me feel like the forest nymph I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late planning:&lt;/strong&gt; I definitely suffered from decision fatigue at several points in the process both caused and cured by our long engagement. I had time to focus on other things in life. I also had to adjust to trusting others to do things for me. I never wanted to burden my family, so they had to convince me that it made them happy to be involved. My parent&amp;#39;s bathroom also broke (twice) in the summer before the wedding, so we spent a lot of weekends travelling up to their house to paint, build fences, rake the bonfire pile, landscape, make the benches, so so many things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day/week of:&lt;/strong&gt; This is where I really learned to trust people. Our coordinator was excellent in keeping everyone on the same page with expectations and timelines. Our sisters made such gorgeous design decisions, our parents handled all the major broad strokes, and everyone was committed to keep us out of stress. It was great. Really the only thing I can complain about is that we didn&amp;#39;t have good enough speakers for the dancing playlists we created. They provided good background music, but had never been tested with bodies packed into the tent so they couldn&amp;#39;t generate over too much talking. We still danced and had a blast, but really check this if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re planning. By the time the day of rolled around though, I just so wanted to be married that everything seemed to roll off my back. I knew someone would take care of everything because we had a whole team supporting us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing the backyard wedding:&lt;/strong&gt; At the start of the process, we thought it was going to save us money. Probably we could have done this, but we learned a lot about the tastes of our families and ourselves through the process. With some more work on our part, we probably could have saved a bit more, but not a ton. In the end, the backyard let us customize so much that it&amp;#39;s now all anyone can talk about: the wedding felt so much like US! It was so much friggin work that I&amp;#39;m still kind of exhausted but it ended up being so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of about 30k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;55% Food, rentals, and portable toilets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7% Attire&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10% Decor (but it was so much more than this because of the work my parents did to spruce up the lawn and house)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20% professionals (photos, coordination, paper products through minted, DIY music)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4% after-party and brunch the next day&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4% Rehearsal dinner&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pictures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xfhwtk30nxw11.jpg?width=3600&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f03925a9b967236e2d3512245fdd54c2c4dbfd1f\"&gt;My parents bought the benches, we put them together and rubbed them down with linseed oil.

Hoping you can help me with some decision fatigue I'm experiencing right now with choosing a wedding photographer.\n\nI've gotten a bunch of quotes (holy moly, photography is expensive!) and landed on two final choices.\n\nThe first is a photographer from out of our area (which explains her cheaper pricing - just have to pay a minimal travel fee) who has clearly been in the wedding photography business for a while. She has a legit website, access to all of her wedding galleries, is familiar with the venue we've booked, etc. We love her work but fiance is on the fence because her work skews just slightly more \"light and airy\" than he'd like and he's worried that her work may wash out our venue/beach landscape for solo shots a little too much. I love the style so I'm totally on board, but flexible (it's a big investment, so I want us both to be happy!).\n\nThe second photographer is one I found on Instagram - she's clearly very talented with couples but most of her work is 1) styled shoots or 2) couples shoots only (i.e. not weddings). Based on her marketing materials, I can she's still establishing herself, which we're okay with! I've inquired to learn more and she mentioned she was initially undecided between fashion photography or wedding/family photography, so she took a break from weddings for about a year. She ultimately decided she wanted to go towards the wedding route. She sent me some galleries from weddings she's shot in the past but caveated to me that she's since upgraded her equipment and her skills have gotten better (and it shows in her IG portfolio at least!). TBH, I wasn't super impressed with her older work but her new stuff is right in line with what fiance and I want!\n\nAt the moment, pricing for both is the same, though I may try to negotiate with the second photographer. I'm feeling a bit nervous about how she'll end up delivering the photos given the fact she hasn't had the opportunity to shoot a wedding in a while.\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks in advance for your help!",

I am having serious decision fatigue but it's high time I decide about photography. FH doesn't care as much about photography as I do, so I need opinions from you all. I'm stuck between 2 options and really don't know which way to go.\n\nOption #1: Off-resort photog, I like her pictures A LOT better and her prices are much more reasonable. $1100 for 6 hours, 2 shooters, and digital images (minimum 450). I would pay for her lodging at the resort (due to some weird off-resort vendor policies), which is $1200. So total $2300. She has some reviews that she is hard to get in contact with and delivers images very late, which concern me. Her facebook is not super active, but she has been more than understanding of some of my life circumstances over email. FH is concerned that an off-resort photog is not as \"guaranteed\" in terms of image delivery, actually being there, etc. I expressed this to her and she tried to allay my concerns+sent a contract, but it's still a factor. My \"deposit\" for this one is paying for her stay, and the $1100 is not due until images are ready for upload.\n\n\nOption #2: Resort contracted photog, images are about the same quality as #1 but not as great. $2800 for 4 hours, no second shooter. Minimum 200 images. More \"guaranteed\" in that they are affiliated with the resort (so that can't get weird about me bringing in someone from outside). But it seems like a lot.\n\nHelp me weddit, you're my only hope! I really need to decide this week but I am so exhausted from thinking through this for so long that I just have no idea.",

I can't justify the cost of real flowers, I don't want to DIY flowers (I have other DIY stuff to deal with and don't even know where I'd start), and I convinced myself I would be ok with fake flowers even though deep down I knew I wouldn't be because I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on flowers.\n\nI bought the $125 bouquet impulsively on Etsy after spending hours and hours and hours online trying to find what I was looking for. I didn't read the fine print. I didn't read the part where they don't accept returns. I feel like such an idiot. I had decision fatigue and just wanted to be done.\n\nIt came today. In the pictures it looked beautiful, and if it were real I would love it. But in spite of my attempts to convince myself otherwise, I *hate* fake flowers and I hate this bouquet.\n\nI emailed the shop about accepting a return and maybe she will take pity on me (Edit: she responded and won't take a return... ugh). I guess i'll try reselling it or something. In the end, $125 isn't the end of the world, but as you all know this shit adds up.\n\nSo I guess I've learned 1) not to let my impatience and frustration get the better of me and 2) that I can't talk myself into loving something I don't like. Fortunately, my MOH is hooking me up with a friend who can do my bouquet (with real flowers) on the cheap.\n\nThanks for indulging my rant.",

I can&amp;#39;t justify the cost of real flowers, I don&amp;#39;t want to DIY flowers (I have other DIY stuff to deal with and don&amp;#39;t even know where I&amp;#39;d start), and I convinced myself I would be ok with fake flowers even though deep down I knew I wouldn&amp;#39;t be because I didn&amp;#39;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on flowers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought the $125 bouquet impulsively on Etsy after spending hours and hours and hours online trying to find what I was looking for. I didn&amp;#39;t read the fine print. I didn&amp;#39;t read the part where they don&amp;#39;t accept returns. I feel like such an idiot. I had decision fatigue and just wanted to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It came today. In the pictures it looked beautiful, and if it were real I would love it. But in spite of my attempts to convince myself otherwise, I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; fake flowers and I hate this bouquet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I emailed the shop about accepting a return and maybe she will take pity on me (Edit: she responded and won&amp;#39;t take a return... ugh). I guess i&amp;#39;ll try reselling it or something. In the end, $125 isn&amp;#39;t the end of the world, but as you all know this shit adds up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;#39;ve learned 1) not to let my impatience and frustration get the better of me and 2) that I can&amp;#39;t talk myself into loving something I don&amp;#39;t like. Fortunately, my MOH is hooking me up with a friend who can do my bouquet (with real flowers) on the cheap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for indulging my rant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am suffering from decision fatigue so I was really tempted to just purchase it. Looking at the world of veil options out there online I'm now even more confused (especially because it seems that online you can pay $50 and get a hugely ornate cathedral length veil). It's hard to justify paying $300.\n\nHere's another picture of the back of the dress w/full train: [https://i.redd.it/9744aefzivd21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/9744aefzivd21.jpg)\n\n* What kind of veil would you get, if you were me, that would match the dress? Fingertip or cathedral or other? \n* If fingertip, what should I be looking for to find \"dupes\" of Veil #1? \n* Any tips for buying veils online and what to look for?\n\nThanks y'all!",

We're also planning this from far away - this is about 30 minute south of DC, and we live in Boston - and my parents are in Richmond, VA, so in general we aren't super familiar with the area and many people will be traveling, even if it's just an hour and a half.  \nI'm trying to figure out how to be able to afford to feed anyone that is staying at the campsite for the whole duration, but at the same time we can't fully follow the rule of feeding anyone travelling from out of town because it's almost a destination wedding for everyone and we'll have somewhere from 150 to 180 guests....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe good news is, we have a super industrial sized kitchen on site (walk in fridge and all). Are we totally bonkers if we try to do something on-site and buy a ton of prepped food from Costco? We will still have to bring all cooking pans/utensils...and I'm worried that at this point I'll be too stressed to enjoy cooking for a large group, even if it's already prepped. But at the same time, I don't know how much we can budget for an event style rehearsal dinner...I'm thinking of landing somewhere in the middle and having a big BBQ delivery to the site or someone pick it up and bring it (we're doing a Korean BBQ fusion for the day of, so at least we wouldn't be doing back to back American BBQ).  \n\n\nAnyways - I guess we're asking multiple questions at this point.   \n1) How much is too much to expect ourselves to do to prep the rehearsal dinner\n\n2) Are Costco Shrimp cocktails/Salads/Prepped meals/giant platters of cheese too casual? \n\n3) How many people are we reasonably expected to invite to this thing? (planning on anyone staying in cabins on site and anyone involved in the wedding...)  \n4) Anyone super knowledgeable about the Triangle/Quantico VA area have some stellar suggestions? We don't want to venture too far from the park if we do leave the site just because DC traffic can be a nightmare and it's labor day weekend.  \n\n\nThanks for any and all insight...the decision fatigue is already starting to set in!",

We&amp;#39;re also planning this from far away - this is about 30 minute south of DC, and we live in Boston - and my parents are in Richmond, VA, so in general we aren&amp;#39;t super familiar with the area and many people will be traveling, even if it&amp;#39;s just an hour and a half.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m trying to figure out how to be able to afford to feed anyone that is staying at the campsite for the whole duration, but at the same time we can&amp;#39;t fully follow the rule of feeding anyone travelling from out of town because it&amp;#39;s almost a destination wedding for everyone and we&amp;#39;ll have somewhere from 150 to 180 guests....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is, we have a super industrial sized kitchen on site (walk in fridge and all). Are we totally bonkers if we try to do something on-site and buy a ton of prepped food from Costco? We will still have to bring all cooking pans/utensils...and I&amp;#39;m worried that at this point I&amp;#39;ll be too stressed to enjoy cooking for a large group, even if it&amp;#39;s already prepped. But at the same time, I don&amp;#39;t know how much we can budget for an event style rehearsal dinner...I&amp;#39;m thinking of landing somewhere in the middle and having a big BBQ delivery to the site or someone pick it up and bring it (we&amp;#39;re doing a Korean BBQ fusion for the day of, so at least we wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing back to back American BBQ).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways - I guess we&amp;#39;re asking multiple questions at this point.&lt;br/&gt;\n1) How much is too much to expect ourselves to do to prep the rehearsal dinner&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Are Costco Shrimp cocktails/Salads/Prepped meals/giant platters of cheese too casual? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) How many people are we reasonably expected to invite to this thing? (planning on anyone staying in cabins on site and anyone involved in the wedding...)&lt;br/&gt;\n4) Anyone super knowledgeable about the Triangle/Quantico VA area have some stellar suggestions? We don&amp;#39;t want to venture too far from the park if we do leave the site just because DC traffic can be a nightmare and it&amp;#39;s labor day weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any and all insight...the decision fatigue is already starting to set in!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It seems to balance the sparkle level with a simple design.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr...should I go with something else entirely? Maybe more simple? To be honest I'm having decision fatigue with my outfit, and I'd love other opinions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I tried to add a photo of me in the dress, but it didn't go through...I'm terrible at Reddit. If it helps, I have dark curly hair that I will be wearing up and dark tan skin (I'm wearing an ivory dress and gold/pink accessories) ",

I will be wearing &lt;a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/610443347/bridal-earrings-white-opal-wedding?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;amp;ga_search_query=Bridal+Earrings%2C+white+opal+wedding+earrings%2C+pearl+bridal+earrings%2C+pearl+earrings%2C+wedding+jewelry+ARLETTE&amp;amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;amp;sca=1\"&gt;these earrings&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women/louise/rose-water\"&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt; (I wear these glasses everyday, and I think they look &amp;quot;bridal&amp;quot;), and this &lt;a href=\"https://www.jjshouse.com/One-tier-Lace-Applique-Edge-Cathedral-Bridal-Veils-With-Applique-006120949-g120949\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt;. I love the simplicity of the dress, so I don&amp;#39;t want to add a belt, but I want a little more sparkle. Since the neckline is so open, I was thinking of adding a necklace! I really like these options from Olive and Piper...what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.oliveandpiper.com/collections/statement-necklaces/products/aurora-collar?variant=7824356081716\"&gt;Option 1&lt;/a&gt;: I love the simplicity of this, but I&amp;#39;m worried the shape clashes somehow with the earrings?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.oliveandpiper.com/collections/statement-necklaces/products/limited-edition-lucy-crystal-collar\"&gt;Option 2&lt;/a&gt;: This one matches the opal crystal in my earrings, but I&amp;#39;m worried it might be too much?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.oliveandpiper.com/collections/statement-necklaces/products/sophia-crystal-collar\"&gt;Option 3&lt;/a&gt;: My favorite option so far! It seems to balance the sparkle level with a simple design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or...should I go with something else entirely? Maybe more simple? To be honest I&amp;#39;m having decision fatigue with my outfit, and I&amp;#39;d love other opinions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I tried to add a photo of me in the dress, but it didn&amp;#39;t go through...I&amp;#39;m terrible at Reddit. If it helps, I have dark curly hair that I will be wearing up and dark tan skin (I&amp;#39;m wearing an ivory dress and gold/pink accessories) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have only found ONE wedding online with photographs that took place here, and it sure was beautiful! but I know it will take a lot to put together. there is a very competent &amp; experienced event planner local to the area who has been in contact with the campground, but she hasn't actually put on a wedding at that location before.\n\n- accommodations are either: camping, v rustic cabins, so-so rental houses &amp; motels, or a nice resort that's a 30 min drive from the site. \n\n- since going to see the place and FH agreeing to it, I've become concerned about our guests being comfortable there. there is no indoor space, so we would only have tent shelters. the toilets are basically outhouses so we would definitely rent the nice trailer kind. and on our quick walk through (no actual tour yet) it just felt smaller than I expected. of course there's acres and acres of woods and trails, but I'm concerned about the actual site being big enough for all activities and people and roaming about.\n\n- if we have an afterparty, the only thing that really makes sense would be to camp. a fire and beers and s'mores sounds good, but I don't know if that'll be enjoyable for everyone. some cousins &amp; friends (and often myself) like to party and quiet time starts at 10...\n\n\n-\n  \n\nLocation B: an actual wedding venue\n\n- this place is beautiful, however on our tour I realized it was not as woodsy as I had thought. was pretty disappointed with that, but it's still a very beautiful place. there is a flat space with trees that we could set up the ceremony, as I wasn't really fond of their main ceremony space. \n\n- re: logistics, they're a regular wedding venue, I think only a couple years old but they have great reviews. they also have a lot of tables and chairs and other amenities.\n\n- the venue itself has a house for up to 12 that is beautiful! two nights are included in the hefty price tag. the area has some very nice airBnBs, smaller hotels, and isn't far for our hometown friends &amp; family to drive back home.\n\n- would be very comfortable for guests as its a regular &amp; predictable wedding venue :)\n\n- afterparty could take place at a house in the area or a local bar we like. we could even ferry over to Seattle! (but FH said no hah)\n\n-\n\nalso of note: location B does not have ~our date~ available. although I\u2019m thinking it won\u2019t be too bad to change it since we haven\u2019t sent StDs out. checked in with them this week and they have 8.11.2018 still available but \"an unusual number of tours scheduled this weekend\" so that sounds like I need to decide asap if we want it or not.  \n\n-\n\nso\u2026 any advice or input? every time I pick one I want the other. I can\u2019t choose.  \n\n-\n\n**tldr: go with the scenic camping location (and build the wedding from scratch), or a regular wedding venue with all the amenities but not the scenery I want?**  \n\n-\n\n(edited for formatting)",

                    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for the forthcoming lengthy vent. I just don't know who else I can talk to at this point. I don't want to scare my parents or friends who are all so excited about our wedding.\n\nI am ~6 months out. I am exhausted and honestly just don't care anymore. I have, by and large, planned this entire wedding by myself. My mom doesn't care at all. I don't even think she likes my husband-to-be. My dad and stepmom want to contribute financially but otherwise are no help. His parents are the same. My bridesmaids are scattered all across the country and I can't even get them to go shop for dresses yet. My fiance DEFINITELY doesn't care about anything except the fact that there is music and alcohol at the reception. Initially I thought - \"ok, that's fine, I'm a super creative, DIY-loving lady, this will be fun!\" And it was, for a little while, and the day I have planned sounds like so much fun, but now I am just feeling so apathetic and burned out. I have total decision fatigue. I am questioning even having a wedding at all. Wouldn't it be easier to just go to the courthouse tomorrow and be done with it?\n\nHere are my big problems:\n\n#1: Right now, I am looking at a $2000, stunning, gorgeous dress of my dreams. It's bought and paid for, and all that I have left is to get alterations. It is so, so pretty, and I feel amazing in it. It is totally overkill for my venue and theme, though...which is super rustic, campy, casual woodsy. Everything is outside, in the grass and dirt. There is a deck, and a paved pavilion, but I don't see how I'm not going to completely trash my dress before the reception has even started. I picked this venue because I fell in love with it, it totally suits our personalities, but I am seriously questioning my sanity in trying to wear a corset-back, mermaid-style dress with a ridiculous chapel-length train to what amounts to a camp-out dance party in the woods. This dress belongs in some fancy reception hall I could never afford. I am telling people to wear comfortable clothes and not to wear high heels, and here I am totally contradicting myself! What was I thinking? I just tried it on, fell in love, and nothing else compared.\n\n#2: My fiance and I have a daughter together. She will be ~18 months old by the time the wedding is here. Planning anything at all is so hard when you are a mother to an infant at the same time, and paying for it is another story entirely. We have so many responsibilities and things to think about already. I have no idea how she will do during the wedding, and almost think it's not fair to her to be so absorbed in something of my own for that day and the days leading up to it. I am going to be so busy with hair, makeup, getting ready, greeting people, how can I be her mom and give her the attention she needs too? She is very attached to me. (and me to her, really) We've never even spent a night away from each other. I'm the only one that can put her to sleep. I suddenly feel crazy and selfish for even considering a wedding with her in the picture. Has anybody here managed a wedding with a small child?\n\n#3: I have accomplished a lot, but still have so much work to do, and things to pay for. Some of it our parents have offered to cover, but we are still looking at paying out probably both of our entire tax returns and at least putting some money on a credit card. Is it even financially responsible to do this? I can't stop thinking that I should be putting this money into savings, or a college fund for my daughter, or making a downpayment on a house, or literally anything else other than one day.\n\nSo I think about these things, and then I do a total 180 and remind myself that this is my only chance at a wedding, and what if I regret never having had that one day in ten or fifteen years? I want the sweet photo album to look at when we are 50...I want the opportunity to have all the people we love in one place at one time to celebrate us...it sounds amazing but I am so caught up in the details.\n\nI feel bipolar, wishy washy, indecisive and confused. I don't even know what I am looking for by posting this here, other than a place to let out all of these conflicting emotions. Is this normal? I have never been into weddings, never watched even one episode of \"Say Yes to the Dress\" - I feel so out of my element and maybe even like I got caught up in all the Wedding Industry craziness. /sigh \n\nThanks for listening.",

I just don&amp;#39;t know who else I can talk to at this point. I don&amp;#39;t want to scare my parents or friends who are all so excited about our wedding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am ~6 months out. I am exhausted and honestly just don&amp;#39;t care anymore. I have, by and large, planned this entire wedding by myself. My mom doesn&amp;#39;t care at all. I don&amp;#39;t even think she likes my husband-to-be. My dad and stepmom want to contribute financially but otherwise are no help. His parents are the same. My bridesmaids are scattered all across the country and I can&amp;#39;t even get them to go shop for dresses yet. My fiance DEFINITELY doesn&amp;#39;t care about anything except the fact that there is music and alcohol at the reception. Initially I thought - &amp;quot;ok, that&amp;#39;s fine, I&amp;#39;m a super creative, DIY-loving lady, this will be fun!&amp;quot; And it was, for a little while, and the day I have planned sounds like so much fun, but now I am just feeling so apathetic and burned out. I have total decision fatigue. I am questioning even having a wedding at all. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be easier to just go to the courthouse tomorrow and be done with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my big problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1: Right now, I am looking at a $2000, stunning, gorgeous dress of my dreams. It&amp;#39;s bought and paid for, and all that I have left is to get alterations. It is so, so pretty, and I feel amazing in it. It is totally overkill for my venue and theme, though...which is super rustic, campy, casual woodsy. Everything is outside, in the grass and dirt. There is a deck, and a paved pavilion, but I don&amp;#39;t see how I&amp;#39;m not going to completely trash my dress before the reception has even started. I picked this venue because I fell in love with it, it totally suits our personalities, but I am seriously questioning my sanity in trying to wear a corset-back, mermaid-style dress with a ridiculous chapel-length train to what amounts to a camp-out dance party in the woods. This dress belongs in some fancy reception hall I could never afford. I am telling people to wear comfortable clothes and not to wear high heels, and here I am totally contradicting myself! What was I thinking? I just tried it on, fell in love, and nothing else compared.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2: My fiance and I have a daughter together. She will be ~18 months old by the time the wedding is here. Planning anything at all is so hard when you are a mother to an infant at the same time, and paying for it is another story entirely. We have so many responsibilities and things to think about already. I have no idea how she will do during the wedding, and almost think it&amp;#39;s not fair to her to be so absorbed in something of my own for that day and the days leading up to it. I am going to be so busy with hair, makeup, getting ready, greeting people, how can I be her mom and give her the attention she needs too? She is very attached to me. (and me to her, really) We&amp;#39;ve never even spent a night away from each other. I&amp;#39;m the only one that can put her to sleep. I suddenly feel crazy and selfish for even considering a wedding with her in the picture. Has anybody here managed a wedding with a small child?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3: I have accomplished a lot, but still have so much work to do, and things to pay for. Some of it our parents have offered to cover, but we are still looking at paying out probably both of our entire tax returns and at least putting some money on a credit card. Is it even financially responsible to do this? I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking that I should be putting this money into savings, or a college fund for my daughter, or making a downpayment on a house, or literally anything else other than one day.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think about these things, and then I do a total 180 and remind myself that this is my only chance at a wedding, and what if I regret never having had that one day in ten or fifteen years? I want the sweet photo album to look at when we are 50...I want the opportunity to have all the people we love in one place at one time to celebrate us...it sounds amazing but I am so caught up in the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bipolar, wishy washy, indecisive and confused. I don&amp;#39;t even know what I am looking for by posting this here, other than a place to let out all of these conflicting emotions. Is this normal? I have never been into weddings, never watched even one episode of &amp;quot;Say Yes to the Dress&amp;quot; - I feel so out of my element and maybe even like I got caught up in all the Wedding Industry craziness. /sigh &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
