I went to Norway and the Swiss, French, and Italian Alps over three weeks. For the most part, I was backpacking/thru-hiking (tent, not huts or hostels). Overall, it was a big success, I loved it, and I would do it again and am planning my next solo trip! For context, I am a late-20s F. Before this, I have done long (weeks - months) road trips in my home country (US) and Canada, so I already knew I liked traveling solo and prefer time in nature over big cities. \n\nI didn't have firm plans or goals. Honestly, I felt like I had lost myself a bit over the last year or so, and just wanted to spend some quality time with myself and treating myself. Solo travel was perfect to take things at whatever pace I wanted (sometimes slow and relaxed, sometimes wickedly fast). When things go wrong, there's no one to be disappointed, so my mood was pretty high throughout overall. My biggest takeaway was how capable I truly am (I am really truly proud of some of the sh\\*t I did), and feeling really confident to take on more in life. \n\nWhat surprised me the most was how many interesting people I met while traveling, and how high quality the connections were. I was NOT expecting to meet anyone whatsoever, and at times was wondering why people were even talking to me ha. I really was prepared to spend three weeks pretty much by myself, and ended up traveling with someone really cool for almost a week. I would meet people on the trails and sync up with them. I found connections to be quickly intimate and genuine, probably due to the mindset most people are in when traveling solo. Honestly, at times it was MORE socialization than I was looking for, and ended up changing plans a few times to get back to doing my own thing. Another takeaway is that I'm actually quite an interesting and cool person! \n\nMy lessons learned:\n\n* I had to use flight credits for this trip, so I had my return flight booked. I wish I had had flexibility to book my flight with a different airline for more affordable flexibility, as I ended up really wanting to leave from a different city and spent half a day in travel just to get to my flight. (If that didn't make sense, I had to book with a non-budget airline, and it was cost-prohibitive to change my flight).\n* On the same thread, I regret almost every accommodation I had booked in advance. I found I prioritize flexibility over a bed and a shower. I honestly spent a couple nights on the street, and found it wasn't the end of the world. I functioned surprisingly well on little sleep (yay caffeine), and it just ended up feeling like wasted money to go to a hotel unless I was really craving it. Another benefit of solo travel is playing by ear what your needs are each day. \n* I packed light, and I still packed WAY too much. By the end I was just wearing the same pants and shirt every day. If you're considering packing a camp stove overseas, and it's not below freezing, just cold soak. \n* Listen to your gut. I had this long (10 day) hike planned, so I left someplace I was really enjoying to give myself enough time to do the hike. I was absolutely destroyed emotionally leaving earlier than I had wanted, and ended up leaving that hike to explore somewhere else. If you're enjoying somewhere, stay there longer. If you're not enjoying somewhere, find somewhere else to go if you can. In retrospect, it was 100% worth the money to change travel plans for experiences I was enjoying.\n* Say yes! It took me a little bit to lean into this, but just say yes to experiences that come up (provided you feel safe). I regret everything I had said no to. \n* I went in largely without a plan or really knowing what to expect. This worked in my benefit, as multiple times seeing landscapes for the first time in person was STUNNING and I found those moments to be very profound. However, I feel like I just scratched the surface of some of these places. I don't like previews or trailers, so I think this style of travel worked for me, but I do now want to go back to the places I loved and see more! \n* I did end up with decision fatigue at a certain point. I found some ways to combat this. If I had made friends, I leaned in a bit to what they wanted to do, and had great experiences spending a day doing something I may not have picked. I spent a really lovely day going for a chill hike, a modern art museum, and sunset paddle boarding with someone, and it was doubly lovely not having to choose anything. And honestly, if you really don't want to do it, then you have your answer! Another method was by the end of the trip, I just picked an end destination for a hike and wandered my way through the mountains until I got there over a few days. Yay maps! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This worked in my benefit, as multiple times seeing landscapes for the first time in person was STUNNING and I found those moments to be very profound. However, I feel like I just scratched the surface of some of these places. I don&amp;#39;t like previews or trailers, so I think this style of travel worked for me, but I do now want to go back to the places I loved and see more! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I did end up with decision fatigue at a certain point. I found some ways to combat this. If I had made friends, I leaned in a bit to what they wanted to do, and had great experiences spending a day doing something I may not have picked. I spent a really lovely day going for a chill hike, a modern art museum, and sunset paddle boarding with someone, and it was doubly lovely not having to choose anything. And honestly, if you really don&amp;#39;t want to do it, then you have your answer! Another method was by the end of the trip, I just picked an end destination for a hike and wandered my way through the mountains until I got there over a few days. Yay maps! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
