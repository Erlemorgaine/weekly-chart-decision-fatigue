It\u2019s us against Big Grocery, and they are determined to win. Here are some tips and tricks I used when I was in crisis mode and had almost nothing to spend on food. I got out of it alive, you can too. \n\nAlways keep this mantra in your head: Big Grocery is not your friend. They are not there to provide your family with healthy food. They are not \u2018part of the community\u2019. They are there to make money off you, and to do so they engage in some of the most underhanded practices you\u2019ll ever encounter. So lock and load, soldiers, here\u2019s how to do battle. \n\n**1.** Avoid high end grocery stores like the plague. If it has little awnings with French words like \u2018boulangerie\u2019 lettered coquettishly above the bread section, get the hell out of there. If it runs free seminars on cooking with Madagascar capers, leave immediately. Your new foraging grounds should be places like No Frills, Price Chopper, Bulk Barn, Dollarama, Giant Tiger, or any other discount grocer you can find. Otherwise *you* are paying for that charming \u201cWine Tasting the Cheeky Pinot Grigios of Tuscany\u201d event, and all those fancy attempts to convince you that you are actually strolling through a medieval village in France. \n\n**2**. When you first enter the store, you\u2019ll likely be greeted by the fruits and veg, which are brightly lit and colourful to make you feel happy! Retailers think happy people spend more, so they want to start you off in a good mood. Also, if you start there and buy a few healthy things, you\u2019re more likely to feel virtuous that you\u2019ve bought something healthy, so you\u2019re super primed to hit the Twinkies aisle for a treat you deserve. \n\nBy all means, buy the fruit and veg. But don\u2019t fall into their trap and then hit the Krispy Kreme display.\n\n**3**. The bakery is probably there too, tempting you with delicious aromas and the allure of baked goods. Some stores even pump in fake bread smells like realtors spraying baking cookies scent to flog a house. Here you\u2019ll also find cakes and muffins, etc related to holidays, just to further encourage you to buy. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day! It\u2019s Graduation Month! It\u2019s Arbor Day in Uruguay! You\u2019re more likely to pick up something for ole Dad simply out of guilt or filial obligation. \n\nLeave the bakery section til last. You might accidentally on purpose forget to go back. \n\n**4**. The size of the average shopping cart has doubled since the 70\u2019s, and is 300% bigger than when they were invented in the 30\u2019s. Just like dieters know to serve themselves on smaller plates to eat less, there\u2019s a psychological reason not to go for the jumbo cart. You will subconsciously feel like filling it up. And it generally works - sales increased by nearly 30% when the bigger carts were introduced in the 70\u2019s. Also, carts now often have drink holders. These people mean business. They seriously want you to settle in for a long ass ramble around their store, complete with the beverage of your choice. \n\nGo for the smallest cart you can, or use a basket. Better yet, use your hands. If you can\u2019t carry it, don\u2019t buy it. Try taking your bike or scooter to the store - again, if you can\u2019t lug it home, it will prevent you from overbuying.\n\n**5**. Stores these days are the size of airplane hangars for a reason. They know people will shop longer and spend more if they don\u2019t feel crowded, and, perhaps more importantly, you will get tired hiking all over hell\u2019s half acre looking for the fricking eggs. Tired people have less self control and tend to buy what they want, instead of only what they need. People also tend to reach what\u2019s known as Decision Fatigue by about the forty minute point into their shop, where they\u2019re completely blown out by all the thousands of decisions they\u2019ve had to make and will just say screw it and reach for anything. Ever wonder why there are no clocks in big stores? They run these joints like casinos, man.\n\nPlan to get in and get out as quickly as possible. Set a twenty minute timer on your phone, or have a support person back in the car you can turn to for help if you find yourself zombie walking towards the Cheetos. \n\n**6.** The layout of stores is carefully considered. Yes, everyone knows the milk is at the back so that you have to walk through the aisles to get to it. The eggs are often at the other end of the store, and the bread is somewhere else altogether, since retailers know that these three staples are bought by pretty much everyone. The more time you spend wandering around the store like you\u2019re lost in a foreign airport the more chances you have to spot some new marmalade you just have to try. Remember, the store wants you in there for a long time. Changing things around routinely is not because someone in Corporate saw something cute on HGTV - it\u2019s to shake up your routine so you *can\u2019t* just make a beeline for the things you need. \n\nKnow the layout of your store. Make a list of the things you need, and plan your route through the store with the precision and skill of a Navy SEAL. Draw a map if you have to. The more you wander, the more you will buy. If you\u2019re going in for just a carton of milk, pretend you\u2019re a horse running the Preakness and have those blinders on. Get in, get out. You are allowed to buy just one thing and leave. \n\n**7.** Cheaper items are never at eye level. The most \\*profitable\\* items are at eye-level, or \u2018buy level\u2019 as the stores call it. Always look on the bottom of shelves for better prices or value for money. Try brands that you haven\u2019t heard of, if they\u2019re cheaper. The ones you\u2019ve heard of have spent millions in advertising, and they plan to recoup that money by charging you more. Sugary cereals and sweet treats are placed at your kids\u2019 eye level, for obvious reasons. \n\nIf you can smell the coffee, or the chocolate, in those aisles, it might just be aroma pumped in just like in the bakery section. Retailers have been known to do this too, so plug up your nostrils with Kleenex when you go and ignore the stares, it\u2019s so worth it. Ever notice that soup is never in alphabetical order? Hmmm, I wonder why that is\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be faster if you could just zero right in on the Minestrone you want and not have to search through all the other flavours\u2026oh right. Now I get it. \n\nItems on the end of each aisle, called the end cap, give the impression of being sale items, but quite often are not. These are the most valuable real estate in the store, and brands will pay up to a million dollars to feature their products there, because anything put there sells like crazy. \n\nNot everything at the end of the aisle or in special wire bins in the aisles is on sale. The store likes to make you think it is, by sectioning it off in a special way. Check the price, always. Same goes for \u201climit of X\u201d signs. Aside from the Great Covid Run on Toilet Paper, there\u2019s never any reason a store wants to limit how many things you buy, even on sale. They do this to encourage you to buy up to the limit. It\u2019s psychology - if you see a sign saying you can only buy three of something, you start to think this must be a great price, or it must be a really good product in high demand. Occasionally this is true - but make sure you check if it\u2019s genuinely a good price (a loss leader the store is okay with losing money on, because they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll overspend on other things). If it\u2019s an exceptional deal, which happens sometimes, have your spouse grab the limit and go through a separate lane from you. \n\nIf you\u2019re not stretching up to get something, or bending right down to get something, you\u2019re almost definitely paying too much. Don\u2019t assume things you find in wire bins on the end caps are on sale, they most likely aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t get fooled by the impression of scarcity (ie limits)\n\n**8**. Convenience will cost you. Anything that is done for you - shredded cheese, skinless boneless chicken breasts, cut up fruit, etc - will always cost you more. Stores know that we\u2019re all busy and can\u2019t be bothered hand shredding a block of cheese if we don\u2019t have to. They know it\u2019s easier to pick up a plastic tray of a couple of sliced up kiwis and eleven blueberries for $19.99 than it is to buy the raw fruit and cut them up ourselves. You might choose this option on occasion, but always realize you\u2019re paying a premium.\n\nBefore you buy anything that has been chopped up or shredded or prepared for you in some way, check to see how much the unhandled stuff costs. A block of cheese, a whole chicken, whole fruits and veg, etc. They will almost always be much, much cheaper. \n\n**9**. Similar to number 8, bigger is always cheaper. A 355 ml can of pop is often nearly the same, or sometimes even more, than a 2L bottle, and this is true across the board. A giant bag of rice costs less per kg than a box of Uncle Ben\u2019s boil in the bag sachets of parboiled rice. The important thing to keep in mind here is the cost per unit, not the price you see on the shelf, and this is where bulk buying or communal buying can really save you money. \n\nMake a shopping list with your friends or family. If you both need some of the same things, buy a larger item together and split it up at home. It doesn\u2019t take much to split up a bag of potatoes, rice, pasta, etc and store them in your own containers or ziploc. Household supplies like multipacks of toilet paper, paper towels, and even things like household products and cleaners can also be split in half. This works best on 2 for 1 deals, or BOGO half off. \n\n**10.** At the same time, however, be wary of overspending on sale items. Shop the clearance section first, and then make sure you look for the unit price of a sale item, (which will be in tiny type), not the big flashy number ending in .99. You probably know this by now, but remind yourself of this often. Your mission is a long game, you\u2019re trying to save money week over week, not just today. If you consistently buy things based on the best unit price you can get, you\u2019ll save money. Buy multiples only if you are absolutely sure you or your family/friends will use all of it within a month or two. Many a lonely can of tuna has languished, forgotten and alone, in the back of a dark cupboard just because someone slapped a sale sticker on it. \n\n**11**. Use comparison sites to find the best deals, or sites like flashfood.com etc that show you how to buy food that is recently or about to expire (most expiration dates are pretty meaningless, just be careful with meat and dairy). Use coupons if it doesn\u2019t take over your life and turn you into one of those insano preppers who hoard a hundred boxes of Tide. Use air miles points or reward points/programs if it\u2019s easy for you to do, and if you don\u2019t fall into the trap of buying 3 boxes of steel wool you\u2019re never going to use just because it\u2019ll get you one extra air mile. Use a credit card to accumulate points only if you never carry a balance (meaning you pay it off in full every month), and won\u2019t be tempted to buy useless stuff just to get more points. Never count on points, these things can vanish faster than David Copperfield and no one on the help lines will give a rat\u2019s ass. \n\n**12**. Buy no-name or store brand products whenever you can - often they are made by the same companies that make the brand name stuff, the way Old Navy is a lower priced version of The Gap, to make sure they get the bargain shoppers as well as the richer ones. Just be careful not to fall for the \u2018Premium\u2019 or \u2018Select\u2019 line some grocery stores offer. It\u2019s just their no-name line with fancier packaging and a higher price. Beware of terms like \u201cArtisanal\u201d, it\u2019s all just advertising baloney. Anything produced in a factory is not \u2018artisanal\u2019.\n\n**13**. Try to spend most of your grocery money on items that can be made into meals. (Potatoes, rice, pasta, eggs, meat, etc). Spend only about 10% of your budget on ready-made things like chips, snacks, frozen meals, etc. Prioritize protein and healthy fats over carbs (you\u2019ll feel full longer). You may have to spend a bit more time making home made Mac and cheese or fries, but you\u2019ll save a ton of money in the end. Unless you have zero self control, and unless you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t just eat three of them to make up for it, don\u2019t buy those \u2018smaller portions\u2019 packs of chips, cookies etc. They are way more expensive than just buying a large bag or box, and portioning out smaller servings into small snack bags. \n\n**14**. If your grocery store has a bulk section, buy whatever you can there instead of paying for packaging. A scoop of raisins from the bulk section costs less than one in a Sun Maid tin. Bulk Barn is best for things like this, of course, but consider if it\u2019s worth it to drive there instead of just using the bulk section at your grocery store. This is a way to counteract shrinkflation as well. With no packaging to deceive you into thinking you\u2019re getting the same amount as you used to, you can buy exactly how much you want, and for much less, too.\n\n**15.** Unless your vet has specifically told you that your pet needs a special diet, don\u2019t waste money buying the expensive pet food with the pictures of animals eating out of crystal dishes and utter nonsense like that. All pet food comes from the leftover processing of human food, and none of it varies too much from brand to brand. There\u2019s no harm in giving your pet the cheapest pet food, it\u2019s likely no different than the expensive stuff. Sometimes a can of tuna works out cheaper than cat food, your cat will be more than happy with that. Don\u2019t buy pet treats or things that will remove tartar, etc - in most cases, it\u2019s utterly pointless. Dogs and cats do just fine without dental care, why would they need it in their food? Pet food is marketed to humans, always keep that in mind. \n\n**16**. Never even venture into the kitchenware section of a grocery store (I\u2019m looking at you, Loblaws). It may be more convenient to buy spatulas or mugs or plastic food containers while you\u2019re shopping, but you will pay through the nose for it. You can get any of those things at the dollar store or a thrift store for much much less. \n\n**17.** Don\u2019t buy anything at the checkout. You don\u2019t need anything they sell there. The store wants you to buy that stuff because it makes the most profit on these items, sometimes with a markup of around 40%, while most of their other products have a markup of only 2 or 3%. They also figure you\u2019re so tired from making so many decisions while shopping that you\u2019re just not capable of resisting the urge for a sugar fix, or remembering that you can get batteries cheaper at the dollar store, or realising that if you really *must know* what Megan Markle is wearing this Spring, you can check out a digital version of the same magazine from your library. \n\nIf you want to grab a snack or a drink on the way out, don\u2019t buy a single bottle or a single bag of chips/candy bar etc. Buy a four pack of pop, or a four pack of chocolate bars, or a large bag of chips, and take one/some out when you leave. It works out much, much cheaper. \n\nCheckout aisles are intentionally designed to be narrow so that you\u2019re stuck there like a sheep being funnelled into the shearing yard. The stores figure if you change your mind about buying something, they\u2019d rather you feel the social pressure of all those behind you and say \u2018oh to hell with it\u2019 and just buy it anyway, rather than put it back. Ever try leaving a store without buying something once you\u2019ve entered? It\u2019s locked down tighter than Fort Knox, sometimes you actually have to slip past someone trying to buy something just to escape. \n\n**18**. Never buy plastic bags, this \u2018pay 25 cents to help the environment\u2019 is just another way to make money. Absolutely everything - including fruit, for heaven\u2019s sake - is wrapped in plastic in these places, sometimes more than one layer thick, and yet a shopping bag is the problem? Bring bags with you, every time.\n\n**19**. Don\u2019t round up to donate at the till, or feel guilty when they ask if you\u2019d like to donate a dollar to support X charity. You are your own charity right now. You can be generous again in the future. This is mission critical time, soldier, you need every penny right now.\n\n**20**. If something has gone bad when you get it home, like the milk is already sour, take it back. Yes, you can take back food that has gone off, provided you don\u2019t wait a week, for obvious reasons. You can also negotiate a discount if the thing you want to buy is expiring today, just ask someone.\n\n**21**. Get your loonie back from the cart. Hell, check to see how many people have forgotten to retrieve theirs while you\u2019re at it, sometimes you luck out. \n\n**22**. Your final challenge will be to escape the store\u2019s final gauntlet of coffee shops, vending machines, lottery ticket kiosks, shoe shine places and key making joints. Blinders on, people. Put your head down and get the hell out of there, and out of the parking lot without being lured over to the drive thru that\u2019s conveniently plunked down right near the entrance/exit (and for which the fast food giant has paid the grocery store some serious cash). Your mission is completed, now get your stash home and thank God you made it through another week. \n\n**Bonus tip** \\- online shopping avoids pretty much all of these temptations and tricks. But if you must go to the store, sign up for instacart and do someone else\u2019s shopping while you\u2019re at it. Might as well earn while you\u2019re spending. ",

We didn\u2019t start the war, but nevertheless, we\u2019re in the trenches now. It\u2019s us against Big Grocery, and they are determined to win. Here are some tips and tricks I used when I was in crisis mode and had almost nothing to spend on food. I got out of it alive, you can too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always keep this mantra in your head: Big Grocery is not your friend. They are not there to provide your family with healthy food. They are not \u2018part of the community\u2019. They are there to make money off you, and to do so they engage in some of the most underhanded practices you\u2019ll ever encounter. So lock and load, soldiers, here\u2019s how to do battle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid high end grocery stores like the plague. If it has little awnings with French words like \u2018boulangerie\u2019 lettered coquettishly above the bread section, get the hell out of there. If it runs free seminars on cooking with Madagascar capers, leave immediately. Your new foraging grounds should be places like No Frills, Price Chopper, Bulk Barn, Dollarama, Giant Tiger, or any other discount grocer you can find. Otherwise &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are paying for that charming \u201cWine Tasting the Cheeky Pinot Grigios of Tuscany\u201d event, and all those fancy attempts to convince you that you are actually strolling through a medieval village in France. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;. When you first enter the store, you\u2019ll likely be greeted by the fruits and veg, which are brightly lit and colourful to make you feel happy! Retailers think happy people spend more, so they want to start you off in a good mood. Also, if you start there and buy a few healthy things, you\u2019re more likely to feel virtuous that you\u2019ve bought something healthy, so you\u2019re super primed to hit the Twinkies aisle for a treat you deserve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By all means, buy the fruit and veg. But don\u2019t fall into their trap and then hit the Krispy Kreme display.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;. The bakery is probably there too, tempting you with delicious aromas and the allure of baked goods. Some stores even pump in fake bread smells like realtors spraying baking cookies scent to flog a house. Here you\u2019ll also find cakes and muffins, etc related to holidays, just to further encourage you to buy. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day! It\u2019s Graduation Month! It\u2019s Arbor Day in Uruguay! You\u2019re more likely to pick up something for ole Dad simply out of guilt or filial obligation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave the bakery section til last. You might accidentally on purpose forget to go back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;. The size of the average shopping cart has doubled since the 70\u2019s, and is 300% bigger than when they were invented in the 30\u2019s. Just like dieters know to serve themselves on smaller plates to eat less, there\u2019s a psychological reason not to go for the jumbo cart. You will subconsciously feel like filling it up. And it generally works - sales increased by nearly 30% when the bigger carts were introduced in the 70\u2019s. Also, carts now often have drink holders. These people mean business. They seriously want you to settle in for a long ass ramble around their store, complete with the beverage of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go for the smallest cart you can, or use a basket. Better yet, use your hands. If you can\u2019t carry it, don\u2019t buy it. Try taking your bike or scooter to the store - again, if you can\u2019t lug it home, it will prevent you from overbuying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;. Stores these days are the size of airplane hangars for a reason. They know people will shop longer and spend more if they don\u2019t feel crowded, and, perhaps more importantly, you will get tired hiking all over hell\u2019s half acre looking for the fricking eggs. Tired people have less self control and tend to buy what they want, instead of only what they need. People also tend to reach what\u2019s known as Decision Fatigue by about the forty minute point into their shop, where they\u2019re completely blown out by all the thousands of decisions they\u2019ve had to make and will just say screw it and reach for anything. Ever wonder why there are no clocks in big stores? They run these joints like casinos, man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan to get in and get out as quickly as possible. Set a twenty minute timer on your phone, or have a support person back in the car you can turn to for help if you find yourself zombie walking towards the Cheetos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; The layout of stores is carefully considered. Yes, everyone knows the milk is at the back so that you have to walk through the aisles to get to it. The eggs are often at the other end of the store, and the bread is somewhere else altogether, since retailers know that these three staples are bought by pretty much everyone. The more time you spend wandering around the store like you\u2019re lost in a foreign airport the more chances you have to spot some new marmalade you just have to try. Remember, the store wants you in there for a long time. Changing things around routinely is not because someone in Corporate saw something cute on HGTV - it\u2019s to shake up your routine so you &lt;em&gt;can\u2019t&lt;/em&gt; just make a beeline for the things you need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Know the layout of your store. Make a list of the things you need, and plan your route through the store with the precision and skill of a Navy SEAL. Draw a map if you have to. The more you wander, the more you will buy. If you\u2019re going in for just a carton of milk, pretend you\u2019re a horse running the Preakness and have those blinders on. Get in, get out. You are allowed to buy just one thing and leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Cheaper items are never at eye level. The most *profitable* items are at eye-level, or \u2018buy level\u2019 as the stores call it. Always look on the bottom of shelves for better prices or value for money. Try brands that you haven\u2019t heard of, if they\u2019re cheaper. The ones you\u2019ve heard of have spent millions in advertising, and they plan to recoup that money by charging you more. Sugary cereals and sweet treats are placed at your kids\u2019 eye level, for obvious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can smell the coffee, or the chocolate, in those aisles, it might just be aroma pumped in just like in the bakery section. Retailers have been known to do this too, so plug up your nostrils with Kleenex when you go and ignore the stares, it\u2019s so worth it. Ever notice that soup is never in alphabetical order? Hmmm, I wonder why that is\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be faster if you could just zero right in on the Minestrone you want and not have to search through all the other flavours\u2026oh right. Now I get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Items on the end of each aisle, called the end cap, give the impression of being sale items, but quite often are not. These are the most valuable real estate in the store, and brands will pay up to a million dollars to feature their products there, because anything put there sells like crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everything at the end of the aisle or in special wire bins in the aisles is on sale. The store likes to make you think it is, by sectioning it off in a special way. Check the price, always. Same goes for \u201climit of X\u201d signs. Aside from the Great Covid Run on Toilet Paper, there\u2019s never any reason a store wants to limit how many things you buy, even on sale. They do this to encourage you to buy up to the limit. It\u2019s psychology - if you see a sign saying you can only buy three of something, you start to think this must be a great price, or it must be a really good product in high demand. Occasionally this is true - but make sure you check if it\u2019s genuinely a good price (a loss leader the store is okay with losing money on, because they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll overspend on other things). If it\u2019s an exceptional deal, which happens sometimes, have your spouse grab the limit and go through a separate lane from you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re not stretching up to get something, or bending right down to get something, you\u2019re almost definitely paying too much. Don\u2019t assume things you find in wire bins on the end caps are on sale, they most likely aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t get fooled by the impression of scarcity (ie limits)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;. Convenience will cost you. Anything that is done for you - shredded cheese, skinless boneless chicken breasts, cut up fruit, etc - will always cost you more. Stores know that we\u2019re all busy and can\u2019t be bothered hand shredding a block of cheese if we don\u2019t have to. They know it\u2019s easier to pick up a plastic tray of a couple of sliced up kiwis and eleven blueberries for $19.99 than it is to buy the raw fruit and cut them up ourselves. You might choose this option on occasion, but always realize you\u2019re paying a premium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you buy anything that has been chopped up or shredded or prepared for you in some way, check to see how much the unhandled stuff costs. A block of cheese, a whole chicken, whole fruits and veg, etc. They will almost always be much, much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;. Similar to number 8, bigger is always cheaper. A 355 ml can of pop is often nearly the same, or sometimes even more, than a 2L bottle, and this is true across the board. A giant bag of rice costs less per kg than a box of Uncle Ben\u2019s boil in the bag sachets of parboiled rice. The important thing to keep in mind here is the cost per unit, not the price you see on the shelf, and this is where bulk buying or communal buying can really save you money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a shopping list with your friends or family. If you both need some of the same things, buy a larger item together and split it up at home. It doesn\u2019t take much to split up a bag of potatoes, rice, pasta, etc and store them in your own containers or ziploc. Household supplies like multipacks of toilet paper, paper towels, and even things like household products and cleaners can also be split in half. This works best on 2 for 1 deals, or BOGO half off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; At the same time, however, be wary of overspending on sale items. Shop the clearance section first, and then make sure you look for the unit price of a sale item, (which will be in tiny type), not the big flashy number ending in .99. You probably know this by now, but remind yourself of this often. Your mission is a long game, you\u2019re trying to save money week over week, not just today. If you consistently buy things based on the best unit price you can get, you\u2019ll save money. Buy multiples only if you are absolutely sure you or your family/friends will use all of it within a month or two. Many a lonely can of tuna has languished, forgotten and alone, in the back of a dark cupboard just because someone slapped a sale sticker on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;. Use comparison sites to find the best deals, or sites like flashfood.com etc that show you how to buy food that is recently or about to expire (most expiration dates are pretty meaningless, just be careful with meat and dairy). Use coupons if it doesn\u2019t take over your life and turn you into one of those insano preppers who hoard a hundred boxes of Tide. Use air miles points or reward points/programs if it\u2019s easy for you to do, and if you don\u2019t fall into the trap of buying 3 boxes of steel wool you\u2019re never going to use just because it\u2019ll get you one extra air mile. Use a credit card to accumulate points only if you never carry a balance (meaning you pay it off in full every month), and won\u2019t be tempted to buy useless stuff just to get more points. Never count on points, these things can vanish faster than David Copperfield and no one on the help lines will give a rat\u2019s ass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;. Buy no-name or store brand products whenever you can - often they are made by the same companies that make the brand name stuff, the way Old Navy is a lower priced version of The Gap, to make sure they get the bargain shoppers as well as the richer ones. Just be careful not to fall for the \u2018Premium\u2019 or \u2018Select\u2019 line some grocery stores offer. It\u2019s just their no-name line with fancier packaging and a higher price. Beware of terms like \u201cArtisanal\u201d, it\u2019s all just advertising baloney. Anything produced in a factory is not \u2018artisanal\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;. Try to spend most of your grocery money on items that can be made into meals. (Potatoes, rice, pasta, eggs, meat, etc). Spend only about 10% of your budget on ready-made things like chips, snacks, frozen meals, etc. Prioritize protein and healthy fats over carbs (you\u2019ll feel full longer). You may have to spend a bit more time making home made Mac and cheese or fries, but you\u2019ll save a ton of money in the end. Unless you have zero self control, and unless you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t just eat three of them to make up for it, don\u2019t buy those \u2018smaller portions\u2019 packs of chips, cookies etc. They are way more expensive than just buying a large bag or box, and portioning out smaller servings into small snack bags. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;. If your grocery store has a bulk section, buy whatever you can there instead of paying for packaging. A scoop of raisins from the bulk section costs less than one in a Sun Maid tin. Bulk Barn is best for things like this, of course, but consider if it\u2019s worth it to drive there instead of just using the bulk section at your grocery store. This is a way to counteract shrinkflation as well. With no packaging to deceive you into thinking you\u2019re getting the same amount as you used to, you can buy exactly how much you want, and for much less, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless your vet has specifically told you that your pet needs a special diet, don\u2019t waste money buying the expensive pet food with the pictures of animals eating out of crystal dishes and utter nonsense like that. All pet food comes from the leftover processing of human food, and none of it varies too much from brand to brand. There\u2019s no harm in giving your pet the cheapest pet food, it\u2019s likely no different than the expensive stuff. Sometimes a can of tuna works out cheaper than cat food, your cat will be more than happy with that. Don\u2019t buy pet treats or things that will remove tartar, etc - in most cases, it\u2019s utterly pointless. Dogs and cats do just fine without dental care, why would they need it in their food? Pet food is marketed to humans, always keep that in mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt;. Never even venture into the kitchenware section of a grocery store (I\u2019m looking at you, Loblaws). It may be more convenient to buy spatulas or mugs or plastic food containers while you\u2019re shopping, but you will pay through the nose for it. You can get any of those things at the dollar store or a thrift store for much much less. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17.&lt;/strong&gt; Don\u2019t buy anything at the checkout. You don\u2019t need anything they sell there. The store wants you to buy that stuff because it makes the most profit on these items, sometimes with a markup of around 40%, while most of their other products have a markup of only 2 or 3%. They also figure you\u2019re so tired from making so many decisions while shopping that you\u2019re just not capable of resisting the urge for a sugar fix, or remembering that you can get batteries cheaper at the dollar store, or realising that if you really &lt;em&gt;must know&lt;/em&gt; what Megan Markle is wearing this Spring, you can check out a digital version of the same magazine from your library. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to grab a snack or a drink on the way out, don\u2019t buy a single bottle or a single bag of chips/candy bar etc. Buy a four pack of pop, or a four pack of chocolate bars, or a large bag of chips, and take one/some out when you leave. It works out much, much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Checkout aisles are intentionally designed to be narrow so that you\u2019re stuck there like a sheep being funnelled into the shearing yard. The stores figure if you change your mind about buying something, they\u2019d rather you feel the social pressure of all those behind you and say \u2018oh to hell with it\u2019 and just buy it anyway, rather than put it back. Ever try leaving a store without buying something once you\u2019ve entered? It\u2019s locked down tighter than Fort Knox, sometimes you actually have to slip past someone trying to buy something just to escape. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;. Never buy plastic bags, this \u2018pay 25 cents to help the environment\u2019 is just another way to make money. Absolutely everything - including fruit, for heaven\u2019s sake - is wrapped in plastic in these places, sometimes more than one layer thick, and yet a shopping bag is the problem? Bring bags with you, every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt;. Don\u2019t round up to donate at the till, or feel guilty when they ask if you\u2019d like to donate a dollar to support X charity. You are your own charity right now. You can be generous again in the future. This is mission critical time, soldier, you need every penny right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;. If something has gone bad when you get it home, like the milk is already sour, take it back. Yes, you can take back food that has gone off, provided you don\u2019t wait a week, for obvious reasons. You can also negotiate a discount if the thing you want to buy is expiring today, just ask someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt;. Get your loonie back from the cart. Hell, check to see how many people have forgotten to retrieve theirs while you\u2019re at it, sometimes you luck out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt;. Your final challenge will be to escape the store\u2019s final gauntlet of coffee shops, vending machines, lottery ticket kiosks, shoe shine places and key making joints. Blinders on, people. Put your head down and get the hell out of there, and out of the parking lot without being lured over to the drive thru that\u2019s conveniently plunked down right near the entrance/exit (and for which the fast food giant has paid the grocery store some serious cash). Your mission is completed, now get your stash home and thank God you made it through another week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus tip&lt;/strong&gt; - online shopping avoids pretty much all of these temptations and tricks. But if you must go to the store, sign up for instacart and do someone else\u2019s shopping while you\u2019re at it. Might as well earn while you\u2019re spending. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
