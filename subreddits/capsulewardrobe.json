I have gone through some of the previous posts, which provide some great methods for incrementally building a capsule. But what I am specifically looking for are resources which outline the principles of what looks good with what else - I feel that within a capsule, everything should go with everything else - and that is something I am having a hard time figuring out.\n\nAny such resources are greatly appreciated. If my understanding is not quite right, please do point that out too!\n\nThanks a lot! ",

I have gone through some of the previous posts, which provide some great methods for incrementally building a capsule. But what I am specifically looking for are resources which outline the principles of what looks good with what else - I feel that within a capsule, everything should go with everything else - and that is something I am having a hard time figuring out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any such resources are greatly appreciated. If my understanding is not quite right, please do point that out too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hi All! I thought I would make this post as a quick start guide for capsule wardrobes. I always see the posts that are asking \u201chow to start,\u201d \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d \u201cwhat pieces do I need?,\u201d and thought having a resource post might be a good idea for the sub.\n\n*If you have anything you'd like to add please let me know and I can edit the post to include it.*\n\nFirst off a Capsule Wardrobe is any collection of clothing that has interchangeably with each other. A Capsule Wardrobe is not just neutral items, it can be colorful and print heavy it is PERSONAL. A capsule wardrobe should fit your actual life scenario and a \u201cbasic\u201d for you may not be a \u201cbasic\u201d for me. It\u2019s okay to not have a white button up if you have a lifestyle that doesn\u2019t really need a white button up.\n\nYou need to think about why you\u2019re starting a capsule wardrobe. Are you doing it because it\u2019s the trendy thing to do or do you have other reasons? Those reasons can play into how you shop for and construct your wardrobe. If you are trying to cut down on decision fatigue you\u2019re going to want more cohesion than anything else. If you\u2019re starting one because of sustainability you\u2019re going to want to look for fabrics, fibers, and brands that hold up that value of sustainability, so you may want to thrift more of your pieces.\n\n**Where should I start?**\n\nThe best place to start is in your own closet. Going through what you own already can  inform what gaps you have in your wardrobe and what you need. You can also try doing a [10x10 challenge](https://stylebee.ca/10-x-10-challenge/) or a [Project 333](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333-guide/) to get started. You absolutely do not need to immediately get rid of all your clothing and buy an entirely new wardrobe, and if you are on the fence about whether to keep or get rid of you can pack it away and if you are not reaching for it then de-clutter it.\n\nAllison Bornstein has a great closet editing method called the \u201c[AB Method.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV7KjuT4f1Q)\u201d That is great if you are having a hard time starting because it works with what you already have.\n\n**How many pieces should I own?**\n\nThat depends on you and your lifestyle but the typical SEASONAL capsule is around 30-40 pieces meaning that an YEAR-ROUND capsule is around 120-160 pieces. Most people do not include socks/underwear or athletic wear in their capsules or have a separate athletic capsule. Some people also make micro capsules of around 10 items for special circumstances, such as traveling.\n\n**What Colors should I buy/own?**\n\nColor analysis is a big trend right now and it can definitely be helpful if you don\u2019t already know what colors look best on you. You can do analysis online [here](https://colorwise.me/) but keep in mind it can be inaccurate. At the end of the day though you should wear what you like and would be happy with. I personally do not wear black but so many people love it. Do what makes you happy.\n\n**I am trying to emulate X style, how should I do that?**\n\nA great way to find out where you want to go with your style is to create a Pinterest board of styles that you like. At first go ham, pin everything that is interesting to you, you can refine later. There are lots of things that I like but would wear myself and that is okay and totally normal.\n\nFrom there look for the common threads between the outfits. Such as a lot of them feature a jean jacket, or a lot of them have doc martens, etc. and what you like about each one. You can then form a list as a reference point or what that style entails in a component type of way.\n\n**I like really different styles. How can I merge them?**\n\nMy three main core \u201caesthetics\u201d would probably be Western, Academic, and Safari. The way I go about blending these three together is listing adjectives for each and seeing which adjectives are shared and which are not. This is easiest put together in a [Venn Diagram so you can see mine here](https://imgur.com/a/78Z2ij6).\n\nAfter you identify what that center of the Venn-diagram is that is the core of your style.

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All! I thought I would make this post as a quick start guide for capsule wardrobes. I always see the posts that are asking \u201chow to start,\u201d \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d \u201cwhat pieces do I need?,\u201d and thought having a resource post might be a good idea for the sub.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have anything you&amp;#39;d like to add please let me know and I can edit the post to include it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off a Capsule Wardrobe is any collection of clothing that has interchangeably with each other. A Capsule Wardrobe is not just neutral items, it can be colorful and print heavy it is PERSONAL. A capsule wardrobe should fit your actual life scenario and a \u201cbasic\u201d for you may not be a \u201cbasic\u201d for me. It\u2019s okay to not have a white button up if you have a lifestyle that doesn\u2019t really need a white button up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to think about why you\u2019re starting a capsule wardrobe. Are you doing it because it\u2019s the trendy thing to do or do you have other reasons? Those reasons can play into how you shop for and construct your wardrobe. If you are trying to cut down on decision fatigue you\u2019re going to want more cohesion than anything else. If you\u2019re starting one because of sustainability you\u2019re going to want to look for fabrics, fibers, and brands that hold up that value of sustainability, so you may want to thrift more of your pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where should I start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best place to start is in your own closet. Going through what you own already can  inform what gaps you have in your wardrobe and what you need. You can also try doing a &lt;a href=\"https://stylebee.ca/10-x-10-challenge/\"&gt;10x10 challenge&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"https://bemorewithless.com/project-333-guide/\"&gt;Project 333&lt;/a&gt; to get started. You absolutely do not need to immediately get rid of all your clothing and buy an entirely new wardrobe, and if you are on the fence about whether to keep or get rid of you can pack it away and if you are not reaching for it then de-clutter it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allison Bornstein has a great closet editing method called the \u201c&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV7KjuT4f1Q\"&gt;AB Method.&lt;/a&gt;\u201d That is great if you are having a hard time starting because it works with what you already have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many pieces should I own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That depends on you and your lifestyle but the typical SEASONAL capsule is around 30-40 pieces meaning that an YEAR-ROUND capsule is around 120-160 pieces. Most people do not include socks/underwear or athletic wear in their capsules or have a separate athletic capsule. Some people also make micro capsules of around 10 items for special circumstances, such as traveling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Colors should I buy/own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Color analysis is a big trend right now and it can definitely be helpful if you don\u2019t already know what colors look best on you. You can do analysis online &lt;a href=\"https://colorwise.me/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but keep in mind it can be inaccurate. At the end of the day though you should wear what you like and would be happy with. I personally do not wear black but so many people love it. Do what makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am trying to emulate X style, how should I do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great way to find out where you want to go with your style is to create a Pinterest board of styles that you like. At first go ham, pin everything that is interesting to you, you can refine later. There are lots of things that I like but would wear myself and that is okay and totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there look for the common threads between the outfits. Such as a lot of them feature a jean jacket, or a lot of them have doc martens, etc. and what you like about each one. You can then form a list as a reference point or what that style entails in a component type of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like really different styles. How can I merge them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My three main core \u201caesthetics\u201d would probably be Western, Academic, and Safari. The way I go about blending these three together is listing adjectives for each and seeing which adjectives are shared and which are not. This is easiest put together in a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/78Z2ij6\"&gt;Venn Diagram so you can see mine here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you identify what that center of the Venn-diagram is that is the core of your style. That would be the things that you should always have in your outfits to create your personal style. You can see that mine has; Earth Toned, and Natural at the center, so it would be very out of styling for me to wear something like Canary yellow sequin dress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the other adjectives are things that you can add and take away to create more of one look or the other. You can also do this with specific pieces such as a button up shirt and boots could be shared between all of mine but the button up shirt and boot style might change between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Apps do People Use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally use an excel sheet that auto-populates a count of how often I&amp;#39;ve worn an item and you can find the template &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZM_1soBMKg5F-lFmun6Pkctw2ttiRstZff31UZRM8o0/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;here for that&lt;/a&gt;. However, a lot of people like the following apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whering \u2192 Free&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ACloset \u2192 Free&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;StyleBook \u2192 1 Time cost&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OpenWardrobe\u2192 Free&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Indyx \u2192 Free but with some paid options&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pureple \u2192 Free but with some paid options&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cladwell \u2192Basic is Free but can upgrade to $8/mo&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please let me know if you see any other common questions that I can outline in this post. I expect it to grow and change overtime and I would love to add a recs section for pieces people tend to ask about a lot such as office wear items or tees.

                    "selftext": "This is my personal process for how to refine your bigger wardrobe into a launch point for capsule wardrobes that are specific to how YOU live your life. I didn\u2019t follow any hard rules about item numbers etc, but I used all the concepts that come up with hardcore capsules to create functional clothing groups that give most of the same benefits: a smaller number of items as options for a set time period to reduce decision fatigue, colour cohesion to make picking an outfit fool proof, and rotating items to keep yourself excited if you like variety. And also, how to make sure you engage with all items you already own, and be able to THOUGHTFULLY look for need-based gaps and fill them with items that will fit into your existing collection.\n\nI find that a lot of newer capsule wardrobe information out there is about buying whole new trendy capsules or starting from scratch, or is very focused on being as minimal as possible and is quite restrictive. Also, many visual examples don\u2019t actually seem functional, especially for my extreme seasons climate (Alberta, Canada). \nSince this didn\u2019t fully align with what I was looking to do, I thought others may feel similarly and might get something out of my process. \n\nSo, without further ado, my steps:\n\n1) Pull out EVERYTHING: clothes, outerwear, shoes, accessories if they are large/obvious/seasonal-specific.\n\nKonMarie it and get rid of anything that doesn\u2019t bring you happiness\u2026whether it be texture, fit, warmth, etc; if something about it makes you not want to wear it, then say thank you and goodbye. Another useful way to think about it is, would I buy this today? Or, would I bring it on vacation? Don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself if you can\u2019t eliminate a lot, there will be more opportunities to refine with more techniques. Conversely, don\u2019t be afraid to get rid of something you know will create a gap; you don\u2019t want to hold onto it only because it\u2019s functional. Or keep it but put it on a list of looking for perfect replacements. \n\n2) Sort your clothes into ACTIVITY/SEASON groups that are specific to your life. \n\nI say within groups, because you will want to create multiple function capsules if you are not planning on being a minimalist. And even if you do want to, this is a good launch point to think about the activities in YOUR life and get to know what items you already have. Then, maybe for you, a whole activity category will just equal one outfit or can be satisfied with items from another group.\n\nAlso good about groups, is they can all have their own colour schemes. (More next step) This might help with a large wardrobe that has too many existing colours breaking out into something that makes sense in the end. \n\nPersonally, my groups are:\n\n-house lounge and bed wear\n\n-yardwork clothes (I garden a lot)\n\n-workout/hiking/camping clothes\n\n-cold weather outerwear (will explain more later)\n\n-super cold weather outerwear (ditto) \n\n-seasonal daily wardrobe x 4\n\nYou might have other categories such as:\n\n-job-specific (office, farm labour, etc)\n\n-activity-specific (triathlon, painting, etc)\n\n3) Look for existing colour palettes within a category.\n\nIf you keep categories as separate capsules, then on a surface level your wardrobe can contain colours that would clash if worn with each other, but if you only pick from one capsule a time, then that doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll still look put together! It also gave me more freedom to keep more colours which I enjoyed, and to work within what I already own.\n\nFor example, for me, my warm clothes tended to be: black, grey, navy, and maroon, with some reds and some browns. This was my launch point for my Oct-March options. \n\nIf there are pieces in an outlier colour, consider if you really want that piece or not. For example, I had a burnt orange cardigan, and literally do not own a single other item in that colour, and I realized I tend to not wear it often because of this, and then realized I did not want it anymore (even though it made it through konmari). \n\n3) Then, create a category capsule (and repeat for other categories)\n\nPull everything you would consider wearing for an activity category, or for a season. Start with the current season until a particular date when you\u2019ll switch. For example, I picked Oct Nov Dec, because the really cold weather here typically starts in Jan.\n\nFrom what you pulled, refine your choices.\n\n-Use colours to split your items. For example, I put all my reds into Oct Nov Dec, and removed my maroons to go in Jan Feb Mar. This enabled me to remove clashing and still use all the things I already have, and have a shift in colours to look forward to. \n\n-Think about what YOU actually wear to be comfortable, not just style or examples of what others wear.\n\nI found it helpful to think of what I would possibly wear without other items, or what would require combos. Like, I won\u2019t wear sweaters without an underlayer, but I don\u2019t like that underlayer to be a tee shirt because it shows at the collar. So what sweaters did I keep, and what do they require under them for me to actually wear them? Could I find a single item that works as an underlayer for all of them? On the flip side, a tee is too cold, so what will be worn over it, etc. \n\nAnd also, what will I take off/leave on, when visualizing possible outfits. For myself, I personally hate inspo capsule outfit examples where it is the same outfit with two different coats, or one with a cardigan and one without, because I will be taking off the warm layer when I go indoors. It\u2019s the same outfit underneath, that\u2019s one outfit. Same with scarfs, I wear them to keep warm outside but I won\u2019t wear them once I\u2019m indoors, so they\u2019re not part of an outfit. But that\u2019s because that\u2019s how I personally wear clothes, and why every wardrobe is unique and you think about your own life. :)\n\nFrom there, you can leave it at that for that capsule if you want, regardless of item numbers, or pick rules and refine further.\n\nThen repeat for other categories. \n\nFor your seasonal daily wardrobe or a category that is out of season, put everything you didn\u2019t select in a separate place to go thru next time. You can also pre-sort that stuff into the next capsule-options so it\u2019s easier to grab when you want to switch.\n\nI wanted to mention, another thing I don\u2019t really see any inspo examples of is outerwear capsules. For more mild weather, that makes sense, you\u2019re probably just adding a coat, and it is more likely to be coordinated with what goes under it, as you might see it all together. \n\nBut for true cold winter weather, you\u2019re probably wearing a hat, a big-ass coat, a scarf, gloves, and boots. You might only see pants and sock tops from underneath. And then you take it all off when you go indoors. To me, cold weather outerwear is its own capsule that you will want to unify and that can have its own colour palette. \n\n4) Finally, making sure everything gets worn and edited and gaps get filled. \n\nThe hanger trick: when you first make your current capsule, hang up everything on a backwards hanger. Hang it up normally after you have worn it, and you will see what hasn\u2019t been used. Force yourself to wear everything at least once, or, if you don\u2019t, ask yourself why and if that item is something you still want.\n\nIdentify gaps/replace items with better versions as the season/activity progresses. \n\nHope this helps someone!",

It\u2019s so nice knowing that you don\u2019t have to worry about if the clothes in your closet fit or go together and the lack of options means takes away some of the decision fatigue I was experiencing. I told myself that I would give it 30 days and then reevaluate if I wanted to keep going and I definitely do. I chose decently for my wardrobe and only had to go outside of my capsule once for a special occasion (family pictures where my mom insisted that we wear coordinated clothes). I\u2019m going to make the following changes though:\n\n1. Switch out my black sneakers for a new pair- I discovered this month that my black ones have a hole in them so I definitely need new ones.\n\n2. Switch out my sperrys for black flats. I found that I didn\u2019t love the look of my sperrys with the clothes in my capsule and found myself wanting another work-appropriate pair of shoes.\n\n3. Take out my blue jeggings and black boot cut pants. I added these in to give some variety to my wardrobe but in reality I didn\u2019t like the way they fit on me so I didn\u2019t really wear them. I\u2019d rather just wear normal jeans so I\u2019m adding another pair of jeans to my wardrobe. \n\n4. I didn\u2019t love the red dress I chose for the capsule. I\u2019m either going to replace it with a white skirt or a red skirt with white accents. I\u2019m testing out the white skirt this weekend and if I like it I\u2019ll choose the white skirt. \n\n5. I\u2019m subbing out my blue striped cardigan for a grey cardigan as I like the way that one looks better.\n\n6. I\u2019m also adding in a white t shirt to my wardrobe and a blue blouse. Turns out the reason why everyone recommends a white tshirt is because it\u2019s really versatile.\n\n7. I\u2019m taking the necklace out as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to count it towards my 33 items.\n\n\nThese changes leave me with the following in my wardrobe:\n\n\n3 sleeveless blouses\n\n4 tshirts (3 of these are nice enough that I can throw a cardigan over and wear them to work)\n\n5 blouses\n\n2 cardigans\n\n1 jacket \n\n3 pairs of jeans (1 pair of mom jeans, 2 pairs of skinny jeans)\n\n1 pair of colored jeans\n\n3 pairs of shorts\n\n1 white skirt \n\n1 belt\n\n2 pairs of sneakers (1 running, 1 white pair)\n\n2 pairs of sandals (black flip flops, grey and tan wedges)\n\n2 pairs of flats (black, gold)\n\n1 pair of boots (black ankle)\n\n2 bags (tan backpack and crossbody bags)",
