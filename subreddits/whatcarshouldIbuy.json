As much as I love the 4Runner, I no longer have the need for the extra space and could use something significantly more fuel efficient. While I'm a rather average-sized human at 5'7\", my partner is 6'4\" (as are the brother-in-law and father, although they obviously won't be in the vehicle with nearly the same frequency) so passenger clearance/room is ideal.

It has a ls2 with a 6 speed auto. The previous owner did cam, headers and exhaust. The car does need a tune and the AFM deactivation done. I bought it because I live in Australia and I was under the impression that since the cars used to be made here for ages, parts would be cheap and since it's essentially GM it should be easy to work on. The car is assembled a bit questionably but it's not a big deal. My car got wrecked recently and I had to send it in for repair. The repairers are taking for ever due to a parts shortage and articles are coming out lately that confirm this parts shortage aswell. This leads me to think that maybe this won't be such a affordable v8 to keep as a daily. \n\nFrom where I'm sitting, I have 3 options. \n1. Keep the car, pay what needs to be fixed and roll with it.unsure how this will go,as Holden stopped making parts in 2017 so the parts shortages will only get worse.\n2. Sell the clubsport and buy a 2016 or 2017 mustang gt. The worth and demand  of clubsports is only growing so I 100% know I'd be able to get a mustang gt. They are fairly common here so the running costs in terms of parts to maintain and maybe even slightly mod would be fairly manageable. \n3. Sell the clubsport and buy a focus rs. I like all the things that make the rs special and it's a way smaller engine so fuel and breaks and other running cost would be lower. But like the Clubsport ,the RS hasn't been produced since 2018 so I could face a parts shortage there swell. And I like the sound of a v8, I can get an exhaust for the rs but would that be enough. \n\nI'm really torn between the options and I'm honestly not sure what to do. I own the clubsport outright so all the money from the sale would be mine and since waiting for it to get fixed,I have managed to save about $5000 to get mods and what not for the car I end up going with .

I\u2019ve had it in the shop for repairs this year more than any other, and while that is to be expected considering the vehicle\u2019s age, I\u2019m growing unenthused with my ownership. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve researched every possible vehicle twice over this year and am still coming up short. My budget is maxed out at $33K CDN (roughly $25K USD). I find myself being drawn to used luxury wagons and SUVs like the Volvo V60, Acura RDX and Lexus NX for their design language and seemingly spacious and comfortable interiors. There\u2019s a part of me that wants me to be reasonable and look for a Forester or CX-5, like CR tells me to, but another that wants me to go with my heart, knowing there\u2019s a chance I could regret going with the more \u201cpractical\u201d route. \n\nI\u2019ve found the aforementioned vehicles in my area with  relatively low mileage and clean CarFax reports, but I would love advice on if these models are reliable enough or excessively costly to upkeep. \n\nMaybe there are more affordable alternatives I should be looking at instead with a comparable level of comfort and style. I would like to keep my next vehicle for at least 5 years. Overall, I feel like I have intense decision fatigue and need to be steered into some kind of direction.",

I\u2019ve had it in the shop for repairs this year more than any other, and while that is to be expected considering the vehicle\u2019s age, I\u2019m growing unenthused with my ownership. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I\u2019ve researched every possible vehicle twice over this year and am still coming up short. My budget is maxed out at $33K CDN (roughly $25K USD). I find myself being drawn to used luxury wagons and SUVs like the Volvo V60, Acura RDX and Lexus NX for their design language and seemingly spacious and comfortable interiors. There\u2019s a part of me that wants me to be reasonable and look for a Forester or CX-5, like CR tells me to, but another that wants me to go with my heart, knowing there\u2019s a chance I could regret going with the more \u201cpractical\u201d route. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve found the aforementioned vehicles in my area with  relatively low mileage and clean CarFax reports, but I would love advice on if these models are reliable enough or excessively costly to upkeep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe there are more affordable alternatives I should be looking at instead with a comparable level of comfort and style. I would like to keep my next vehicle for at least 5 years. Overall, I feel like I have intense decision fatigue and need to be steered into some kind of direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The thing is a gas guzzler. I think it averages 12 miles to the gallon. I've spent money keeping it up over the years (had to fix the transmission, put a used engine in, some type of valve that sits on top of the engine, blower motor, etc). By now I could have spent all that money on a better car but I didn't have the money at the time. I'm still not sure if I do.\n\nRight now none of the car windows roll down and if it gets above 90F the AC blows out hot air. It's an oven on wheels. I try to drive it as little as possible and when I drive long distances, I rent from Enterprise. I've kept putting off buying a car because I don't think I can afford one. \n\n**I have $5100 in an emergency savings account and my goal is $10,000 before making any other purchases. Any time I look at loans it tells me with a 3-4% APR that I'm looking at $450 or more payments on a $16,000 car. I'm hesitant to pull money out of savings because I don't know what will happen with the economy. I work a stable job with state government, but you never know what will happen and I try to play it safe. However, my parents think that I should buy a car now.** They say I have put it off for long enough and that now is a prime time to buy something since companies are begging people to spend money. I looked yesterday and Hyundai and Subaru are offering things like \"0% APR financing for up to 60 months PLUS 90 days until 1st payment.\" If I'm not mistaken that means I won't pay interest for up to 60 months, correct? If that's the case what if it takes me longer? Does all of the accrued interest suddenly get tacked on in a similar way to Care Credit?\n\n**I put my salary into a \"how much car can I afford\" calculator online and it told me about $16,500. So, I'm thinking about trying to keep it under $17k unless there's a good reason to stretch up a bit.** I'm conflicted on what car to buy and when I should buy, so I will just post my info below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gross annual salary: $46,356**\n\n**Net monthly income: $2,894.63**\n\n**Monthly expenses: $900-1500 depending on bills.** I am debt free starting in July except for an $80 student loan payment. I will only be paying for rent/utilities/other living expenses. Have been working for 1.5 years to get to this point and am hoping I can start saving more now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cars I'm interested in: Hyundai, Subaru, Nissan, but I'm open to suggestions.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most important factors for me (Descending order):**\n\n1. Affordability\n2. Fuel efficiency\n3. Features\n4. Performance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want something fun to drive. By that I mean it has some get up and go (my car doesn't), maneuvers well, has smooth and quiet handling on the highway, is zippy, has a nice interior with nice features. For whatever reason I have always wanted a car with a nice interior and features. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I realize that I can't have everything but some things that I like from car rentals are:**\n\n* Media screen\n* Bluetooth and AUX capabilities\n* Push to start\n* Steering Wheel controls\n* Heated seats\n* Heated mirrors\n* Blind spot collision\n* sun/moon roof\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cars I have looked at online:**\n\n* Hyundai Elantra\n* Hyundai Sonata\n* Subaru Impreza\n* Nissan Sentra\n* Nissan Versa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm personally leaning towards the Elantra or Impreza.** I don't think I need a full size sedan after renting several compact sedans from enterprise and being just fine. I can save the money there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I have decision fatigue. I've never bought a car before and don't even know what I should do.** \n\n1. Should I buy new or used? \n2. Now with no or little downpayment or later with larger downpayment? \n3. What make/model? \n4. Is $17k and less a good ball park figure to aim for or should I stretch my finances further?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm trying to at least narrow down some good choices so I can just focus on costs. Hopefully you guys can help me with that.**",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I currently drive a 1998 Ford Explorer with almost 300k miles on it.&lt;/strong&gt; It was purchased brand new by my step mother in 1998 and given to me in 2013. The thing is a gas guzzler. I think it averages 12 miles to the gallon. I&amp;#39;ve spent money keeping it up over the years (had to fix the transmission, put a used engine in, some type of valve that sits on top of the engine, blower motor, etc). By now I could have spent all that money on a better car but I didn&amp;#39;t have the money at the time. I&amp;#39;m still not sure if I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now none of the car windows roll down and if it gets above 90F the AC blows out hot air. It&amp;#39;s an oven on wheels. I try to drive it as little as possible and when I drive long distances, I rent from Enterprise. I&amp;#39;ve kept putting off buying a car because I don&amp;#39;t think I can afford one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have $5100 in an emergency savings account and my goal is $10,000 before making any other purchases. Any time I look at loans it tells me with a 3-4% APR that I&amp;#39;m looking at $450 or more payments on a $16,000 car. I&amp;#39;m hesitant to pull money out of savings because I don&amp;#39;t know what will happen with the economy. I work a stable job with state government, but you never know what will happen and I try to play it safe. However, my parents think that I should buy a car now.&lt;/strong&gt; They say I have put it off for long enough and that now is a prime time to buy something since companies are begging people to spend money. I looked yesterday and Hyundai and Subaru are offering things like &amp;quot;0% APR financing for up to 60 months PLUS 90 days until 1st payment.&amp;quot; If I&amp;#39;m not mistaken that means I won&amp;#39;t pay interest for up to 60 months, correct? If that&amp;#39;s the case what if it takes me longer? Does all of the accrued interest suddenly get tacked on in a similar way to Care Credit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I put my salary into a &amp;quot;how much car can I afford&amp;quot; calculator online and it told me about $16,500. So, I&amp;#39;m thinking about trying to keep it under $17k unless there&amp;#39;s a good reason to stretch up a bit.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m conflicted on what car to buy and when I should buy, so I will just post my info below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross annual salary: $46,356&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net monthly income: $2,894.63&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly expenses: $900-1500 depending on bills.&lt;/strong&gt; I am debt free starting in July except for an $80 student loan payment. I will only be paying for rent/utilities/other living expenses. Have been working for 1.5 years to get to this point and am hoping I can start saving more now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cars I&amp;#39;m interested in: Hyundai, Subaru, Nissan, but I&amp;#39;m open to suggestions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most important factors for me (Descending order):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Affordability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fuel efficiency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want something fun to drive. By that I mean it has some get up and go (my car doesn&amp;#39;t), maneuvers well, has smooth and quiet handling on the highway, is zippy, has a nice interior with nice features. For whatever reason I have always wanted a car with a nice interior and features. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I realize that I can&amp;#39;t have everything but some things that I like from car rentals are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Media screen&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth and AUX capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Push to start&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Steering Wheel controls&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Heated seats&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Heated mirrors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Blind spot collision&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sun/moon roof&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cars I have looked at online:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hyundai Elantra&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hyundai Sonata&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Subaru Impreza&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nissan Sentra&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nissan Versa&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m personally leaning towards the Elantra or Impreza.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think I need a full size sedan after renting several compact sedans from enterprise and being just fine. I can save the money there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have decision fatigue. I&amp;#39;ve never bought a car before and don&amp;#39;t even know what I should do.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Should I buy new or used? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now with no or little downpayment or later with larger downpayment? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What make/model? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is $17k and less a good ball park figure to aim for or should I stretch my finances further?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to at least narrow down some good choices so I can just focus on costs. Hopefully you guys can help me with that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
