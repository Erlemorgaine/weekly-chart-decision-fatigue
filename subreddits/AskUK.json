It has to be a combination unit due to space restraints.\n\nThe thing is, I don't know which one to go for and was hoping some of you might have actual experience with either.\n\nWhich one has the quickest wash for a 60degree wash/wash and dry?\n\nIf you have series 8, do you recommend the Idos system and can you still use detergent as usual if you don't fill it up? (I read that it might be prone to clogging and I'm worried about detergent leaking into the machine and other hygiene issues, but otherwise it sounds great!)\n\nDoes your machine make noise/signals and can you disable those beeps?\n\nI'd hugely appreciate your thoughts! I have decision fatigue and never bought a machine like this before :)",
