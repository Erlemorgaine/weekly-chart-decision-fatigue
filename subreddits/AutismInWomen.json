And because I\u2019ve never done a mock assessment I didn\u2019t know what was expected of me. I voiced this, that I needed his requests written down and for him to ask for them. Honestly he has too many patients as he is constantly telling me when I ask him why he wouldn\u2019t have looked over forms I sent before. It was giving professor and teachers assistant vibes, argh!\n\nThe assessment it\u2019s self was traumatising because I have trauma and ptsd so sometimes I\u2019d be answering a question and get emotional\u2026. Human stuff you know. Tell me why the doctor would get upset with me?? I\u2019m very exhausted from the personality shift I\u2019m experiencing from accepting that I do in fact have a developmental neurological disorder and it\u2019s specific name is autism. \n\nI\u2019ve gone through a range of emotions due to my family being health professionals, psychologists and educators and having known and abused me for it. Another thing I\u2019m not quite understanding is that this doctor told me before he finished writing the report that I have severe autism but provided no information. I though this would be laid out in the report but he didn\u2019t add anything else like he said he would. There\u2019s an aspect of this disorder that makes me up unable to talk and  brain scans he took showed that. He has never discussed the results of the brain scan with and never will because he said he is being reviewed due to submitting those kind or results on another patients report. So I\u2019ve been walking around for a month in a daze as to what he has deduced and what the score I got meant. Just no explanation.\n\nI have my report but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s mostly tables and numbers, other people won\u2019t understand it too. I may be panicking but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve wasted 6 months of my life to get this piece of paper that I can\u2019t decipher. When we looked over it today he said he didn\u2019t know what else to include which confused me. I struggled to talk today signing at first then stuttering through tears eventually storming off angrily because he was dismissive. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to tell him I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right when he has dismissed me a number of times and i don\u2019t actually have the \u201ccan do\u201d to talk.

I have just formed r/autisticwomensgroup in order to facilitate voting on dates and times. I'll also be posting materials there, like the group rules and format, as well as our shared topics brainstorming sheet. It's a private sub, but just request to join and I will approve you.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am frustrated with the fact that there are so few Zoom groups out there for people like us and am thinking of starting one myself. I wanted to share my idea for the format here and see how many people would be interested in participating in something like this.\n\nImagined format:\n\n* One hour\n* Every two weeks\n* On Zoom (I have a subscription)\n* Each meeting would be very focused on a single topic relevent to us, such as decision fatigue, sensory overstimulation, our traits and how they manifest, reachback/afterburn, etc. There would be a masterlist of topics that anyone in the group could add to\n* Each meeting would draw from set discussion questions/activities/readings drawn from resources like books and worksheets, which we would have completed beforehand\n* During meetings, we would take turns sharing our reflections on the discussion questions/activity, what it made us think of, and what practical application it might have in our lives\n* There would be no crosstalk or feedback. In other words, after a person had shared, we would not give our opinions/judgements on what they had said. We would not give advice. We would share about our own experiences only. This will keep the meeting orderly and non-judgemental (and people would be welcome to contact each other outside of meetings for opinions/advice on a personal basis, of course!) The philosophy of the meeting would be to learn from other people's shares, not to give/get advice. Our motto would be, \"take what you like, and leave the rest.\"  \n* There would be an optional list for contact information for people who would be open to being contacted outside of the meeting\n* Everything that was said within the meeting would be strictly confidential. Gossip about members or anyone else would be discouraged. \n\nLet me know in the comments or by PM whether you would be interested.\n\nEDIT to add that:\n\n* Work outside the meeting would not be required. The discussion questions/exercise would be given inside the meeting as well as outside, and people could come and just reflect in the moment, as they are able\n* Attendance at every meeting would NOT be necessary!!\n* Not mandatory to talk at the meeting - observers welcome!!",

I have just formed &lt;a href=\"/r/autisticwomensgroup\"&gt;r/autisticwomensgroup&lt;/a&gt; in order to facilitate voting on dates and times. I&amp;#39;ll also be posting materials there, like the group rules and format, as well as our shared topics brainstorming sheet. It&amp;#39;s a private sub, but just request to join and I will approve you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am frustrated with the fact that there are so few Zoom groups out there for people like us and am thinking of starting one myself. I wanted to share my idea for the format here and see how many people would be interested in participating in something like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagined format:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One hour&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Every two weeks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On Zoom (I have a subscription)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each meeting would be very focused on a single topic relevent to us, such as decision fatigue, sensory overstimulation, our traits and how they manifest, reachback/afterburn, etc. There would be a masterlist of topics that anyone in the group could add to&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each meeting would draw from set discussion questions/activities/readings drawn from resources like books and worksheets, which we would have completed beforehand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During meetings, we would take turns sharing our reflections on the discussion questions/activity, what it made us think of, and what practical application it might have in our lives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There would be no crosstalk or feedback. In other words, after a person had shared, we would not give our opinions/judgements on what they had said. We would not give advice. We would share about our own experiences only. This will keep the meeting orderly and non-judgemental (and people would be welcome to contact each other outside of meetings for opinions/advice on a personal basis, of course!) The philosophy of the meeting would be to learn from other people&amp;#39;s shares, not to give/get advice. Our motto would be, &amp;quot;take what you like, and leave the rest.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There would be an optional list for contact information for people who would be open to being contacted outside of the meeting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Everything that was said within the meeting would be strictly confidential. Gossip about members or anyone else would be discouraged. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments or by PM whether you would be interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT to add that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work outside the meeting would not be required. The discussion questions/exercise would be given inside the meeting as well as outside, and people could come and just reflect in the moment, as they are able&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attendance at every meeting would NOT be necessary!!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not mandatory to talk at the meeting - observers welcome!!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
