Right now though I'm experiencing severe decision fatigue because I'm not just asked to do paralegal work, I also do all the administrative work and the books as well along with any other little thing asked of me (including making travel plans, picking up groceries, etc.).\n\nI'm very well compensated but recently, since getting COVID at the end of August and having to take a week off, I've been exhausted constantly. Not just physically but mentally. For example, I've been tasked with figuring out which Mac Mini we should get if he wants to be able to use two screens. It could be my ODD kicking in but honestly I feel absolutely fatigued with constantly making decisions for someone else. I haven't even been able to get my boyfriend and myself out of town because I can't  commit on a place and time to go!\n\nDo you all experience this and how do you deal with it?",
