Just a bed.\n\nAn upgrade to the deluxe balcony with a sofa is $1,500 extra. That\u2019s a hefty price tag for a sofa\u2026 but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around a 7 day trip with nowhere to sit in the room. That\u2019s a lot of money that could be going to another cruise!\n\nWe are introverts who will not be out partying all night. I imaging myself wanting to sit on the couch while waiting for her to get ready, enjoy a cup of coffee in the room in the morning, and probably be back in the room a few hours after dinner to wind down with a glass of wine before bed. Just seems like the sofa would create a very comfortable place for all that.\n\nBut\u2026 is the reality that there are plenty of places outside the room to relax and be introverted? I know some people say the are only in their rooms to sleep and shower, but I would think there are also those who do enjoy being in their rooms more.\n\nSo I guess my real question is: are there any introverts out there who do enjoy relaxing in their rooms during a cruise? Are you content with an interior cabin, or is the splurge worth it for a larger room/balcony?",
