I have the nuna Pipa RX car seat so I\u2019m debating between the TRIV and the MIXX. \n\nWhat I like about the mixx is that the seat lays flat to a bassinet so you don\u2019t have to use the infant car seat every time, has bigger wheels and basket, better suspension. Cons, it\u2019s heavy. \n\nWhat I like about the triv is that it\u2019s 11 pounds lighter, and one handed fold. But it requires the infant car seat until baby is big enough for the regular seat. \n\nOther info, once baby is about 8-9 months old primary caregiver will likely be my MIL who\u2019s in her early 70s. Live in the suburbs but we like to hike at nearby parks with wooded trails but won\u2019t likely do so until spring. \n\nAnyone have experience with one or both? I feel like I have decision fatigue and just can\u2019t make up my mind. ",

I have the nuna Pipa RX car seat so I\u2019m debating between the TRIV and the MIXX. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I like about the mixx is that the seat lays flat to a bassinet so you don\u2019t have to use the infant car seat every time, has bigger wheels and basket, better suspension. Cons, it\u2019s heavy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I like about the triv is that it\u2019s 11 pounds lighter, and one handed fold. But it requires the infant car seat until baby is big enough for the regular seat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other info, once baby is about 8-9 months old primary caregiver will likely be my MIL who\u2019s in her early 70s. Live in the suburbs but we like to hike at nearby parks with wooded trails but won\u2019t likely do so until spring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone have experience with one or both? I feel like I have decision fatigue and just can\u2019t make up my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
