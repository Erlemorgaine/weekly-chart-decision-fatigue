                    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We don\u2019t live together, but he typically spends 4-5 nights per week at my apartment. He has a roommate and I do not. I also have 2 dogs and my apartment is ~10 mins closer to his work than his apartment, so it\u2019s just easier/more practical for him to sleep at my apartment instead of the other way around. \n\nI unfortunately allowed us to slip into a routine of me cooking dinner or paying for delivery for what feels like 80-90% of our meals. He basically only takes care of dinner on the nights we go out to a restaurant, which is about 1x per month, at most.\n\nAt first, I was okay with this because I was grateful he was willing to spend so much time at my place and I never had to commute to his place, so I felt like me taking on more of the cooking helped balance things out. But now that we\u2019ve established more of a pattern and have been dating long enough that he no longer feels like a normal \u201cguest\u201d in my apartment, I have been starting to feel resentful for three primary reasons. (1) My grocery bill has gone up exponentially now that I am buying for 2 people; (2) I\u2019m spending so much more time and energy on cooking. Before we started dating, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to eat cereal, ramen, or a hodge podge of snacks for dinner 1-3 times per week when I wasn\u2019t super hungry, but I feel like I can\u2019t do that now that I am also feeding a 6\u201d3\u2019, 195lb male that exercises several times per week. And (3) decision fatigue. Sounds silly, but I hate how much of a mental load shopping/cooking can be when your partner provides zero input and says \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d when asked what sounds good for dinner. If I give 3 options and ask him to pick, he will literally say \u201cany of those sound good, which I know doesn\u2019t help.\u201d So basically, the entire financial, physical, and mental load of meal time falls on me. \n\nBefore my boyfriend and I started dating, I would occasionally order meal kits from HelloFresh. The kits I ordered would send 3-4 meals consisting of two portions. I would normally eat one portion for dinner and bring the other portion for lunch the next day. But when my boyfriend started coming over more regularly, the second portion went to him. When we started dating, I started ordering  HelloFresh a bit more to help with the decision fatigue re: dinner choices and to make shopping a bit easier. There have been a few times where he will make himself a PB&amp;J after dinner bc the HelloFresh portions didn\u2019t fill him up. I have always noticed this, but frankly didn\u2019t care/think it was my responsibility to buy extra groceries to make the portion sizes bigger. \n\nOver the last couple weeks, I had actually been talking with my therapist about gentle ways to bring up my growing resentment/proposed solutions. But then last night, he made a few comments that forced an unexpected convo on the topic and has made me feel much worse about the situation. \n\nLast night, which was Valentine\u2019s Day (he didn\u2019t do anything for Valentine\u2019s Day, not even a card. Though I was expecting this, so I also didn\u2019t get him anything. I should\u2019ve communicated my expectations better, but I was disappointed he didn\u2019t put in ANY effort whatsoever to Valentine\u2019s Day. Anyways, I digress..) and I was cooking dinner. He said something to the effect of he hates how long it takes me to make dinner bc by the time we finish dinner and clean up, it\u2019s basically time for bed. He said he wants to try to work in more quick options for food. I was already a bit annoyed from a long day at work and the lack of initiative on V day, so I snapped back \u201cyou always just expect me to take care of dinner. If you want quicker options, then you can be more decisive and take the initiative to just get what you want and bring it over.\u201d I also told him he could help me cook or sit at the island and chat with me while I cook instead of plopping in front of the tv and watching sports until dinner is ready. To his credit, he responded well to this and said he would work on being more decisive and taking more initiative instead of constantly relying on me to make decisions and execute. \n\nThen somehow the conversation devolved and he eventually made a comment about how he doesn\u2019t always feel like there\u2019s enough food, esp on the nights I make HelloFresh. He told me him eating a PB&amp;J after dinner was his \u201csubtle\u201d way of letting me know I didn\u2019t make enough food. He referenced a non-HelloFresh meal I\u2019d made a few days prior (which I purposely made a giant portion so as to have leftovers for a few days) and said that amount of food was great. He also brought up the fact that I am a big snacker but snacks don\u2019t fill him up as much as they do for me and that he could eat 1000 pretzels and still be hungry.\n\nHe said he hadn\u2019t brought this up earlier bc he recognized I was doing a lot of work and he felt like \u201cwho am I to complain.\u201d I silently agreed \u201cyeah, who tf are you to complain!?\u201d in my head but didn\u2019t say much back.\n\n I was honestly a bit stunned and taken aback, so I just said \u201cwell I guess I won\u2019t order hellofresh anymore so I can control the portion sizes.\u201d Then I  reiterated that he is also free to take the responsibility for dinner whenever he wants and he can make the portion sizes as big as he wants.  I was angry in the moment and felt like it was extremely audacious of him to complain about having to make himself a PB&amp;J after I paid for and cooked the main meal. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve had time to reflect, I\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t bring up the fact that I had already been starting to feel resentful of the disproportionate division of labor/finances and that last night\u2019s complaints about my efforts just poured salt in my wounds. However, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong? Part of me feels extremely petty for keeping score like this, but I\u2019m also not interested in carrying on a relationship where this is the status quo. \n\nSome additional financial context, if it matters: I haven\u2019t explicitly asked him what his income is, but he is a private school teacher and I am an attorney. Context clues indicate I am earning somewhere between 2-3x more than him. However, I also suspect I have more monthly expenses than he does (larger student debt, 2 dogs, I don\u2019t have a roommate to split utilities with, etc), so our levels of disposable incomes may not be too different. \n\nUltimately, his comments about the portion sizing really rubbed me the wrong way and turned me off. It makes me feel defeated, unappreciated, and unmotivated to cook for him anymore. I think another conversation on this topic is in order, but I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it is reasonable of me to expect him to take on ~50% of the expenses (and energy) for dinner even though I earn more than him? How would you go about broaching this subject again?",

I (20F) have been with my bf (20M) for almost 2 years (it'll officially be 2 in August\ud83d\udc96). I've been working like a mule and bouncing between jobs, trying to scrape together money to put into savings as well as be able to do fun stuff and have a social life. Obviously, being that I'm decently young and pretty inexperienced, my previous jobs haven't paid the best. At one point, I was working 2 jobs and I was only getting about 4 hours of sleep per night. Needless to say, I was exhausted. My previous jobs have been retail and food service. I am not a people person and it *drained* me. If you've worked with the public, you know. I had to do a *lot* at my minimum wage jobs and do a *lot* of problem solving on my own. \n\nNow here's the \"issue\":\n\nI've explained to my boyfriend that after working stuff like that, especially the hours I worked, I felt drained and didn't want to have to decide everything when we hung out. Now, when I say everything...I mean EVERYTHING. I have to decide where we're going, what we're doing, what time HE has to get up and ready, if we eat..where we eat, etc. It's exhausting and I've told him before. \n\nThat being said, I'm now a correctional officer. With that, it's  a LOT more mentally draining that retail and fast food. Not only is it a HUGE amount of interaction with other officers, I still have to deal with inmate issues, paperwork, trying to stay alive and unharmed, deal with the lack of AC, etc. \n\nI don't know how to explain my decision fatigue (if that's what it's called. I'm 99.99% sure it is) to him. I really don't want to be having to decide everything and draining myself more when I'm supposed to be recharging, ya know? I don't want this to become an issue.

I (20F) have been with my bf (20M) for almost 2 years (it&amp;#39;ll officially be 2 in August\ud83d\udc96). I&amp;#39;ve been working like a mule and bouncing between jobs, trying to scrape together money to put into savings as well as be able to do fun stuff and have a social life. Obviously, being that I&amp;#39;m decently young and pretty inexperienced, my previous jobs haven&amp;#39;t paid the best. At one point, I was working 2 jobs and I was only getting about 4 hours of sleep per night. Needless to say, I was exhausted. My previous jobs have been retail and food service. I am not a people person and it &lt;em&gt;drained&lt;/em&gt; me. If you&amp;#39;ve worked with the public, you know. I had to do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; at my minimum wage jobs and do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of problem solving on my own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve explained to my boyfriend that after working stuff like that, especially the hours I worked, I felt drained and didn&amp;#39;t want to have to decide everything when we hung out. Now, when I say everything...I mean EVERYTHING. I have to decide where we&amp;#39;re going, what we&amp;#39;re doing, what time HE has to get up and ready, if we eat..where we eat, etc. It&amp;#39;s exhausting and I&amp;#39;ve told him before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I&amp;#39;m now a correctional officer. With that, it&amp;#39;s  a LOT more mentally draining that retail and fast food. Not only is it a HUGE amount of interaction with other officers, I still have to deal with inmate issues, paperwork, trying to stay alive and unharmed, deal with the lack of AC, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain my decision fatigue (if that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s called. I&amp;#39;m 99.99% sure it is) to him. I really don&amp;#39;t want to be having to decide everything and draining myself more when I&amp;#39;m supposed to be recharging, ya know? I don&amp;#39;t want this to become an issue. I absolutely adore my sweet boy, but I really want to address this before I get irritated and snap at him because of my inability to really communicate what I&amp;#39;m wanting. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The familiarity is irresistible. I'm trying to decide if I'm ready for a new relationship, but fear is creeping in and I'm trying to listen to my gut for once. I've been single for the first time in my adult life this year. Life + career can take you anywhere when you are single. I'm trying to reckon with these things...pls help ToT\n\n\\----\n\nIt's been 1 year since the worst breakup of my life with someone I met freshman year of college. We were together for 9 years and lived in multiple cities together; it came to an end in a fairly gentle way, love just wasn't enough and there was lack of reciprocation and miscommunication happening in cycles throughout the years. We met young and basically grew apart; I've been going to therapy since then and have made some noticeable improvements in my self-esteem and anxiety, shadow work. Not sure what her life is like, we've been no-contact except for a few mins chat when exchanging some items months ago.\n\nAfter about 7-8 months I felt ready to try dating again. I hadn't ever really dated before I met my ex because my high school was small, so I'm still pretty inexperienced with dating in general. I'd also never tried dating apps, so I wasn't sure what to expect, I was just craving attention and company and wanted to try out casual connections for the first time. I saw this as a life experience I'd never know if I didn't try it out. I was still somewhat grieving my previous relationship at the time, so I took things very slow. \n\nI've met up with 3 people in person so far since April/May. I connected better with 2 of them, but one of them had to let go for her own needs; it was a healthy closure. This third woman I've been seeing very frequently since meeting on Tinder in about mid-May. We had actually both just set up our accounts within a week of each other. We had an instant connection, it felt magnetic and unexpected. We agree on so many things, it feels so natural to be around her. I've noticed I don't have to suppress who I am, what I like, and can speak my mind way easier with her. I'm sure the wisdom comes from the previous relationship and lessons I've learned, but we seem to have a healthy + honest connection and it came out of nowhere. She even works in the same field as me and shares my interests. Despite wanting to test out the single lifestyle, I've felt so drawn to her it's hard to explain. So drawn that we just returned from a spontaneous international trip to Iceland together that went so smoothly; we travel great together!\n\nNow we're at a point of clarifying this 'grey area'. Neither of us were looking for a serious thing but have caught feelings very naturally with each other over the last few months. 2 days ago I was having a moment of weakness and shared some depressive thoughts I'd been having. She suggested that it'd be ok to ignore her for a bit while I sort things out. I'm about to move apartments this weekend as well so I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. I felt like I needed some space to recharge after our trip (we both need alone time and have talked about that before, both of us are pretty independent). \n\nHowever as we were saying bye I noticed she was tearing up. She confessed she really likes me a lot and explained that she does want to find her person whom she can build something with, so if I'm not ready then she doesn't want to waste her time, which I fully respect. At the beginning of our trip, she mentioned she's glad I'm not in a rush for a relationship, but now her mind has changed, and I think mine has too. The thing is, I'm struggling to determine what my gut is telling me, something I usually ignore like a moron. I do feel more self-confident and in the drivers seat of my life, so I don't think I'd be starting a new relationship for the wrong reasons. I really do like her a lot. I don't want to navel-gaze and string her along. I don't want her to slip away either, our connection feels so right. I even have been looking up soulmate + twin-flame, 3rd love stuff and it registers. Even her friend told her she feels like we have some sort of karmic bond because of how naturally we grew close.\n\nAnyway, this is super long, so I'll wrap up. I have conflicting feelings. Since I have these, should I let her go? If it feels so natural and meant to be, should I just take the leap of faith and try it out? I do like the freedom of being single and un-tethered. I really enjoy her company too, it feels familiar and comfortable; she ticks most if not all of the boxes. Need to journal about it more. Maybe I shouldn't have started dating again so soon. But since our connection is so strong and healthy, it's difficult to make sense of this situation. It's all just so unexpected. I'm also still working on next steps in my career and re-evaluating long term goals. I even told myself to not get in a relationship for a while while I get my shit together. But my shit is together, she said she thinks I'm a catch and listed the reasons why. She sure as hell is one. I suppose there's no finish line for self-development and feeling 'ready again'... I have so much more to mention but I've already written a crazy amount. I have a problem with overthinking as you can tell. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far! lol",

So drawn that we just returned from a spontaneous international trip to Iceland together that went so smoothly; we travel great together!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;re at a point of clarifying this &amp;#39;grey area&amp;#39;. Neither of us were looking for a serious thing but have caught feelings very naturally with each other over the last few months. 2 days ago I was having a moment of weakness and shared some depressive thoughts I&amp;#39;d been having. She suggested that it&amp;#39;d be ok to ignore her for a bit while I sort things out. I&amp;#39;m about to move apartments this weekend as well so I&amp;#39;m feeling pretty overwhelmed. I felt like I needed some space to recharge after our trip (we both need alone time and have talked about that before, both of us are pretty independent). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However as we were saying bye I noticed she was tearing up. She confessed she really likes me a lot and explained that she does want to find her person whom she can build something with, so if I&amp;#39;m not ready then she doesn&amp;#39;t want to waste her time, which I fully respect. At the beginning of our trip, she mentioned she&amp;#39;s glad I&amp;#39;m not in a rush for a relationship, but now her mind has changed, and I think mine has too. The thing is, I&amp;#39;m struggling to determine what my gut is telling me, something I usually ignore like a moron. I do feel more self-confident and in the drivers seat of my life, so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be starting a new relationship for the wrong reasons. I really do like her a lot. I don&amp;#39;t want to navel-gaze and string her along. I don&amp;#39;t want her to slip away either, our connection feels so right. I even have been looking up soulmate + twin-flame, 3rd love stuff and it registers. Even her friend told her she feels like we have some sort of karmic bond because of how naturally we grew close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is super long, so I&amp;#39;ll wrap up. I have conflicting feelings. Since I have these, should I let her go? If it feels so natural and meant to be, should I just take the leap of faith and try it out? I do like the freedom of being single and un-tethered. I really enjoy her company too, it feels familiar and comfortable; she ticks most if not all of the boxes. Need to journal about it more. Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t have started dating again so soon. But since our connection is so strong and healthy, it&amp;#39;s difficult to make sense of this situation. It&amp;#39;s all just so unexpected. I&amp;#39;m also still working on next steps in my career and re-evaluating long term goals. I even told myself to not get in a relationship for a while while I get my shit together. But my shit is together, she said she thinks I&amp;#39;m a catch and listed the reasons why. She sure as hell is one. I suppose there&amp;#39;s no finish line for self-development and feeling &amp;#39;ready again&amp;#39;... I have so much more to mention but I&amp;#39;ve already written a crazy amount. I have a problem with overthinking as you can tell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading if you made it this far! lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have been looking forward to this for so long, and had pictured myself being single and ready to mingle in this new city. Go on dates, make lots of friends, start new activities etc.\n\nHowever, I fell madly in love with a guy from my home city (M27) - we had been friends for a couple years before we started dating - and it has been 4-5 months now. We have already gone on holiday together, met each other's extended families and so on.\n\nThe last 4 weeks or so we have been having constant arguments. I lean avoidant and he leans anxious. We have talked a lot about our past experiences/\"trauma\" and why we attach and react the way we do. He has been very anxious about me leaving, which has pushed me away/annoyed me. We have had very open communication, and it has gotten better. So green flag for that!\n\nI find it daunting to go abroad for longer than we have even been in a relationship, and with the past couple of weeks of arguing I am doubting my feelings more than ever. Plus, I really need the physical contact/sex to feel connected I think, and I'll be lacking that when we are apart.\n\nI have this paradoxical wish to be single and live my life exactly as I please without any responsibilities in New York, but I also currently feel very in love and I care about him. Thing is, I'm so scared the relationship won't work out - that I'll find out we actually aren't THAT compatible (life stages, attachment, career goals etc) and that we can't stay together. Then I'll have missed a chance to potentially find another love of my life in New York... As you can hear I have a bit of FOMO and this grass is greener on the other side mentality.. I know, I know - not great. To be fair, I do not believe there is only 1 soulmate for me in the vast world. There are so many beautiful people.\n\nHow can these two things co-exist? Am I only feeling \"in love\" because I'm used to him and we have shown our vulnerable sides of each other? Will the feelings fade when I move? Sort of \"out of sight out of mind\"? I have so many doubts, and I start lightly flaw-finding/nit-picking sometimes.\n\nAnd its difficult to manage a mixed attachment relationship to begin with - putting long distance between us I only imagine will exacerbate the issues.\n\nTLDR: I'm doubting whether the new love my bf and I feel for each other is enough for me to sacrifice letting loose when I'm abroad in a bigger city than my hometown, where I could potentially date and fall in love with another.

I\u2019m (35 f) currently in the middle of a particularly rough spot with my partner at the moment and wonder if there\u2019s more I can do. \n\nHe (37 m) is incredible, first off. Truly someone who overcame a significant amount of childhood adversity and now had a masters and high ranking job in our state government. He\u2019s motivated, charismatic, detail oriented, and can hold so much procedural knowledge in his head that he can pull out in any given situation it makes me envious. \n\nHe will admit he struggles with alcohol and uses it to cope with anxiety and his difficulties with relaxing in the evenings. However, he *dreads* Mondays. To the point that now Sundays are tainted with this sense of doom almost. I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic, but it\u2019s a frequent rumination. \n\nHe struggles to get out of bed, has massive decision making fatigue, and feels like he\u2019s \u2019falling behind\u2019 and \u2018not actually qualified to do this job if I\u2019m struggling so much with this pressure\u2018. Classic burnout and imposter syndrome, which is exasperating his preexisting conditions. \n\nFor the past 4 months I\u2019ll say it has been at it\u2019s worst. I work from home so I take on the vast majority of the household chores, animal care, and \u2018mental load\u2019 of the house as a way to take that load off his mind. I\u2019ve encouraged him to seek counseling and talk with his doctors about these symptoms, but reasonably he\u2019s frustrated because it\u2019s \u2018another thing on a long list he has to do\u2019. \n\nI offered to get a second job if he truly wanted to quit, thinking the pressure of not having an \u2018exit plan\u2019 was smothering him and we could figure out how to pay the bills without relying so much on his income. But he\u2019s also refused that, saying his long term career goals means he has to stick it out. That being said, it\u2019s an appointed position so the board simply has to say \u2018we don\u2019t like this thing you did so bye\u2019, and he gets 6 months severance and is out of a job. Which is just an additional pressure to *every* work decision he makes. \n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is, is there more I can do to support him? Would it be too forward of me to send him listings on Psychology Today of therapist that work in his area of concern and accept our insurance? If decision fatigue is the man culprit of his exhaustion, would it be helpful if I made a weekly plan so it\u2019s just automatic and he doesn\u2019t have to tap into his reserves? \n\nHow have other long term partnerships weathered these rough patches?

I\u2019m (35 f) currently in the middle of a particularly rough spot with my partner at the moment and wonder if there\u2019s more I can do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He (37 m) is incredible, first off. Truly someone who overcame a significant amount of childhood adversity and now had a masters and high ranking job in our state government. He\u2019s motivated, charismatic, detail oriented, and can hold so much procedural knowledge in his head that he can pull out in any given situation it makes me envious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He will admit he struggles with alcohol and uses it to cope with anxiety and his difficulties with relaxing in the evenings. However, he &lt;em&gt;dreads&lt;/em&gt; Mondays. To the point that now Sundays are tainted with this sense of doom almost. I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic, but it\u2019s a frequent rumination. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He struggles to get out of bed, has massive decision making fatigue, and feels like he\u2019s \u2019falling behind\u2019 and \u2018not actually qualified to do this job if I\u2019m struggling so much with this pressure\u2018. Classic burnout and imposter syndrome, which is exasperating his preexisting conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past 4 months I\u2019ll say it has been at it\u2019s worst. I work from home so I take on the vast majority of the household chores, animal care, and \u2018mental load\u2019 of the house as a way to take that load off his mind. I\u2019ve encouraged him to seek counseling and talk with his doctors about these symptoms, but reasonably he\u2019s frustrated because it\u2019s \u2018another thing on a long list he has to do\u2019. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I offered to get a second job if he truly wanted to quit, thinking the pressure of not having an \u2018exit plan\u2019 was smothering him and we could figure out how to pay the bills without relying so much on his income. But he\u2019s also refused that, saying his long term career goals means he has to stick it out. That being said, it\u2019s an appointed position so the board simply has to say \u2018we don\u2019t like this thing you did so bye\u2019, and he gets 6 months severance and is out of a job. Which is just an additional pressure to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; work decision he makes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I\u2019m asking is, is there more I can do to support him? Would it be too forward of me to send him listings on Psychology Today of therapist that work in his area of concern and accept our insurance? If decision fatigue is the man culprit of his exhaustion, would it be helpful if I made a weekly plan so it\u2019s just automatic and he doesn\u2019t have to tap into his reserves? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How have other long term partnerships weathered these rough patches? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "I've been together with my girlfriend Lara for 6 years.   \nAbout 2-3 years ago right after the pandemic lockdowns ended my girlfriend decided to more seriously pursue her dreams of \"furniture making\". Lara had been thinking about this for many years, and I supported her dreams and helped developing her dream into more concrete goals- providing a brand name, branding guidelines, list of things she should research and develop.  \nSo when it became time for her to \"make or break\" and get serious about it, I supported her fully and rented a small shop. It was at this point I had come to realization that most of the plans that I had drawn up for her in the past years was sat on and not further developed. Now that time became a serious factor with ongoing costs to pay every month, I took up the responsibility of being the primary decision maker of the business in order to progress as quickly as possible and we agreed about it. She owns the business, I run the show.  \nWe were wary of how many relationships fell apart when couples get into business together, but it was the only way for Lara to realize her dreams.  \nAs expected, things started to get difficult in the communication department. While I was moving very quickly in shaping the brand and business in a pathway that allowed for a fledging business to grow into a small but stable one, Lara obsessed over presentation and artistic relevance and often insisted on getting it right/perfect from the get-go in spite of my explanation that we have to work with what we have, with the tools we are given, and we have to operate from a cyclical perspective.  \nLara couldn't overcome this difference in mindset, and was either slow or couldn't produce what I needed to progress. So I kept pivoting to different strategies like reducing the website into a single landing page, until she understood my approach and finally delievered which allowed me to expand the website into a fully fleshed out business site.  \nI won't go into further details about the business since that isn't the point, but long story short(er) Lara continued to hold on the mindset of perfection and was trapped by it, because she saw herself as an designer/artist first. I understood that to be successful in the business of the arts, learning the art of business was just as important.  \nNevertheless, for the first year of business I had dived myself into forming the business whilst spending many hours every week explaining every though process and decision I was/wanted to make, listen to her concerns and try to alleviate those concerns. I did so with the hope that she would understand and grow from it so that we would align and squash our own worry of falling apart. I was also shielding her from decision fatigue, since while she was the business owner, I was a decision maker and thus responsible if the decisions I made were bad.  \nWhat I didn't expect was that she hadn't really come around to understanding my decisions, and she started attacking me for it. I created the brand, the marketing strategy and formulated the type of products and services she could provide. I also learned about the industry enough to formulate the business model. They weren't perfect, but they were the best in the sense of giving the best chance of succeeding. But she expected her most idealistic dreams to be realized by me. And when I wasn't fulfilling it, she became abrasive- even though I was explaining to her every rationale of my decisions.  \nEventually, our communication devolved and it became difficult to work with her on anything. I was trying to help her, but she wasn't trying to help me help her. She became sarcastic and dismissive of things that I requested from her, which usually bit me in the ass of having to work extra long or harder to achieve the same result. I was very macro in terms of management (hence the constant pivoting of strategies to workaround her), but she was very micro in what she expected out of me.  \nAt the end of the first year, I realized a \"poison pill\" had been created in her head. I had made the mistake of oversharing/explaining my decisions, which led her to pick at everything I said. There was mistrust even though I had hoped that by being verbose it would create the opposite effect. I realized that by sharing too much, I was creating more uncertainty.  \nBut I couldn't do anything about it. I reduced how much I shared in terms of my though processes, but maintained enough to continue to make decisions to push the business forward, and in the second year it did. The business became stable, and while not a big success, we were out of the woods. All but the relationship. Lara became even more abrasive, and started dismissing discussions that I wanted to make. I had come to accept that there was a high possibility our relationship would not survive the business, but she depended on me still, and I love her still.  \nIn the second year, nearly all of the decisions I had made that she protested or fought against had proven itself to have been the right choice. However, it wasn't through me that she formed that realization. It became a pattern of always coming from an external source that would validate my decisions. Friends, an exhibition that did a similar thing etc, all except me. Her attitude towards me became even worse. As the business grew, her opinions in decision making grew too, and I lost nearly all decision making \"rights\", even though I was still depended on to make them and kickstart the process. I had hoped that either being her boyfriend supporting her throughout or my track record would smooth-en the process, but it got worse instead.   \nIt's tough to explain, it felt like she needed and wanted me, but she only wanted the me that would do what she wanted. I became a bin of sorts for the things she didn't like to do, even though as a business owner she had to.  \nIn the same second year, something happened that kind of woke me up. Going out drinking with her friends, one of her guy friends started bullying another female friend who was feeling vulnerable, having recently found out her boyfriend was cheating on her. I defended her against her guy friend and told him off. After reporting the story to Lara, I was stunned when Lara didn't say much about it. I felt alone and unsupported by her, even though I had done the right thing.   \nIt was only 1 year later (in the third year) when her friends started trying to patch the friendship that she mildly agreed that I had done the right thing. By now (I'm guessing) after more private conversations with her friends she's started to realize how poorly she has been behaving. However, at the same time I've also started to reflect on how I've been treated since we started the business, and looking further back to before as well. I've never realized how much of a \"provider\" mentality I've had, that I've trimmed out a lot of what I wanted to do for myself in the process by someone who likes to \"take\". As an example, I love Italian food- but she is only amicable to it- neither likes or dislikes. Yet she has never indulged in this food craving of mine except on my birthday, which means I get one thing for myself in a year.  \nShe has started to realize this too and suggested we go satisfy my food cravings a few times, but after so many years of neglect, I've declined her suggestions multiple times because it doesn't feel good to do it. She knows she's walking on egg shells, and I've said to her about my past relationships- that she'll know I'm at my limit/I'm done when I stop trying to communicate and it's just waiting for a fire for me to end it.  \nWe have had a very very, very briefly talked about our difficulties in communicating, and she very quickly acknowledged it and moved the conversation because she knows it's a possible relationship ending conversation.  \nAt this point I feel like I've put the relationship on \"review\". I am well past my limit of what I considered in the past the breaking point in a relationship. Yet, I love her, and I know she loves me. She needs and wants me, but I feel like my end of the relationship has been sorely missing- and I've started to wonder I can find a woman outside her Lara that can make me feel respected, trusted and supported. I dread homemaking with her now because I feel like it would either be difficult, or there would be no \"me\" in it. I've even suggested getting 2 houses. One for her and one for me. She doesn't like it of course. She wants all of me, all the time because she's had that.  \nIf we were to break up, it wouldn't be too messy. I've always told her that her business is hers 100%, and I'm happy that I am able to fulfill her dreams. However, I worry that because she depends on my business acuity so much- it would be difficult to leave her, or break up and still work alongside her.  \nI've been thinking about this for 1 year, and I have no idea what to do. I've built up a lot of stress over the years and even though her business (I am running my own business too at the same time) is become smooth sailing, I haven't been able to decompress and my mental health I think is taking a toll. I am considering taking a break from her, but I'm not so sure about making any big moves. Are we too far gone to patch things up? Was I blind to not see these red flags? Am I better off finding a new partner?",

                    "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been together with my girlfriend Lara for 6 years.&lt;br/&gt;\nAbout 2-3 years ago right after the pandemic lockdowns ended my girlfriend decided to more seriously pursue her dreams of &amp;quot;furniture making&amp;quot;. Lara had been thinking about this for many years, and I supported her dreams and helped developing her dream into more concrete goals- providing a brand name, branding guidelines, list of things she should research and develop.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo when it became time for her to &amp;quot;make or break&amp;quot; and get serious about it, I supported her fully and rented a small shop. It was at this point I had come to realization that most of the plans that I had drawn up for her in the past years was sat on and not further developed. Now that time became a serious factor with ongoing costs to pay every month, I took up the responsibility of being the primary decision maker of the business in order to progress as quickly as possible and we agreed about it. She owns the business, I run the show.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe were wary of how many relationships fell apart when couples get into business together, but it was the only way for Lara to realize her dreams.&lt;br/&gt;\nAs expected, things started to get difficult in the communication department. While I was moving very quickly in shaping the brand and business in a pathway that allowed for a fledging business to grow into a small but stable one, Lara obsessed over presentation and artistic relevance and often insisted on getting it right/perfect from the get-go in spite of my explanation that we have to work with what we have, with the tools we are given, and we have to operate from a cyclical perspective.&lt;br/&gt;\nLara couldn&amp;#39;t overcome this difference in mindset, and was either slow or couldn&amp;#39;t produce what I needed to progress. So I kept pivoting to different strategies like reducing the website into a single landing page, until she understood my approach and finally delievered which allowed me to expand the website into a fully fleshed out business site.&lt;br/&gt;\nI won&amp;#39;t go into further details about the business since that isn&amp;#39;t the point, but long story short(er) Lara continued to hold on the mindset of perfection and was trapped by it, because she saw herself as an designer/artist first. I understood that to be successful in the business of the arts, learning the art of business was just as important.&lt;br/&gt;\nNevertheless, for the first year of business I had dived myself into forming the business whilst spending many hours every week explaining every though process and decision I was/wanted to make, listen to her concerns and try to alleviate those concerns. I did so with the hope that she would understand and grow from it so that we would align and squash our own worry of falling apart. I was also shielding her from decision fatigue, since while she was the business owner, I was a decision maker and thus responsible if the decisions I made were bad.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhat I didn&amp;#39;t expect was that she hadn&amp;#39;t really come around to understanding my decisions, and she started attacking me for it. I created the brand, the marketing strategy and formulated the type of products and services she could provide. I also learned about the industry enough to formulate the business model. They weren&amp;#39;t perfect, but they were the best in the sense of giving the best chance of succeeding. But she expected her most idealistic dreams to be realized by me. And when I wasn&amp;#39;t fulfilling it, she became abrasive- even though I was explaining to her every rationale of my decisions.&lt;br/&gt;\nEventually, our communication devolved and it became difficult to work with her on anything. I was trying to help her, but she wasn&amp;#39;t trying to help me help her. She became sarcastic and dismissive of things that I requested from her, which usually bit me in the ass of having to work extra long or harder to achieve the same result. I was very macro in terms of management (hence the constant pivoting of strategies to workaround her), but she was very micro in what she expected out of me.&lt;br/&gt;\nAt the end of the first year, I realized a &amp;quot;poison pill&amp;quot; had been created in her head. I had made the mistake of oversharing/explaining my decisions, which led her to pick at everything I said. There was mistrust even though I had hoped that by being verbose it would create the opposite effect. I realized that by sharing too much, I was creating more uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything about it. I reduced how much I shared in terms of my though processes, but maintained enough to continue to make decisions to push the business forward, and in the second year it did. The business became stable, and while not a big success, we were out of the woods. All but the relationship. Lara became even more abrasive, and started dismissing discussions that I wanted to make. I had come to accept that there was a high possibility our relationship would not survive the business, but she depended on me still, and I love her still.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn the second year, nearly all of the decisions I had made that she protested or fought against had proven itself to have been the right choice. However, it wasn&amp;#39;t through me that she formed that realization. It became a pattern of always coming from an external source that would validate my decisions. Friends, an exhibition that did a similar thing etc, all except me. Her attitude towards me became even worse. As the business grew, her opinions in decision making grew too, and I lost nearly all decision making &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot;, even though I was still depended on to make them and kickstart the process. I had hoped that either being her boyfriend supporting her throughout or my track record would smooth-en the process, but it got worse instead.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s tough to explain, it felt like she needed and wanted me, but she only wanted the me that would do what she wanted. I became a bin of sorts for the things she didn&amp;#39;t like to do, even though as a business owner she had to.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn the same second year, something happened that kind of woke me up. Going out drinking with her friends, one of her guy friends started bullying another female friend who was feeling vulnerable, having recently found out her boyfriend was cheating on her. I defended her against her guy friend and told him off. After reporting the story to Lara, I was stunned when Lara didn&amp;#39;t say much about it. I felt alone and unsupported by her, even though I had done the right thing.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt was only 1 year later (in the third year) when her friends started trying to patch the friendship that she mildly agreed that I had done the right thing. By now (I&amp;#39;m guessing) after more private conversations with her friends she&amp;#39;s started to realize how poorly she has been behaving. However, at the same time I&amp;#39;ve also started to reflect on how I&amp;#39;ve been treated since we started the business, and looking further back to before as well. I&amp;#39;ve never realized how much of a &amp;quot;provider&amp;quot; mentality I&amp;#39;ve had, that I&amp;#39;ve trimmed out a lot of what I wanted to do for myself in the process by someone who likes to &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;. As an example, I love Italian food- but she is only amicable to it- neither likes or dislikes. Yet she has never indulged in this food craving of mine except on my birthday, which means I get one thing for myself in a year.&lt;br/&gt;\nShe has started to realize this too and suggested we go satisfy my food cravings a few times, but after so many years of neglect, I&amp;#39;ve declined her suggestions multiple times because it doesn&amp;#39;t feel good to do it. She knows she&amp;#39;s walking on egg shells, and I&amp;#39;ve said to her about my past relationships- that she&amp;#39;ll know I&amp;#39;m at my limit/I&amp;#39;m done when I stop trying to communicate and it&amp;#39;s just waiting for a fire for me to end it.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe have had a very very, very briefly talked about our difficulties in communicating, and she very quickly acknowledged it and moved the conversation because she knows it&amp;#39;s a possible relationship ending conversation.&lt;br/&gt;\nAt this point I feel like I&amp;#39;ve put the relationship on &amp;quot;review&amp;quot;. I am well past my limit of what I considered in the past the breaking point in a relationship. Yet, I love her, and I know she loves me. She needs and wants me, but I feel like my end of the relationship has been sorely missing- and I&amp;#39;ve started to wonder I can find a woman outside her Lara that can make me feel respected, trusted and supported. I dread homemaking with her now because I feel like it would either be difficult, or there would be no &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; in it. I&amp;#39;ve even suggested getting 2 houses. One for her and one for me. She doesn&amp;#39;t like it of course. She wants all of me, all the time because she&amp;#39;s had that.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf we were to break up, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be too messy. I&amp;#39;ve always told her that her business is hers 100%, and I&amp;#39;m happy that I am able to fulfill her dreams. However, I worry that because she depends on my business acuity so much- it would be difficult to leave her, or break up and still work alongside her.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this for 1 year, and I have no idea what to do. I&amp;#39;ve built up a lot of stress over the years and even though her business (I am running my own business too at the same time) is become smooth sailing, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to decompress and my mental health I think is taking a toll. I am considering taking a break from her, but I&amp;#39;m not so sure about making any big moves. Are we too far gone to patch things up? Was I blind to not see these red flags? Am I better off finding a new partner?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "So my (40f) fiance (37m) and I have been together for over 5 years now and we bought a house together in early 2021. He has to girls (14 and 11) from a previous marriage. He is fantastic for the most part - understanding, helpful in the male sense, and a great cook and father. \n\nI have been diagnosed with adhd since about a year ago and I'm still really trying to figure out how to manage all of that, and at times working full time and doing adult responsibilities can get overwhelming for me and lead to decision fatigue. \n\nI don't expect him to do all of the things around the house, but he does pick things up for dinner on the way home from work and does a lot of the cooking. He also does the \"man\" stuff like getting tires changed for winter, mowing the lawn, shoveling snow, and putting up/taking down christmas lights.\n\nHis love language is acts of service, so he says that he enjoys doing all of these things, no matter how many times I ask him if he's sure or if I can help, etc. He WANTS to do it. I don't ask him, because I would feel loved with words of affirmation and I actually like knowing which tasks I am responsible for as it helps me do them with the adhd.\n\nThis year he has done my advent calendar with a bunch of acts of service, which was a nice thought that I loved at first because it is very kind and thoughtful. \n\nToday we kind of got into a fight about these things, as sometimes I ask for his opinion and he \"never cares\" so most decisions such as what we watch, what's for dinner, etc - real every day things - are left to me to organize and figure out. It feels like such a pain.\n\nOne of his days was \"pick our a tree ornament together\" and I haven't used it yet. I have had a rough time finding a tree topper I like and everytime I try to get some from Amazon, they're either undeliverable or they arrive broken, so I have to get something else. There isn't a lot around apart from Walmart and Canadian Tire, so I looked for Christmas stores. There are a couple about an hour away, so I brought this to him as a solution to my problem and a use of his offer, but instantly had complaints about how far it was. \n\nI hate asking people to do things for me as I feel like a burden when I do, but have been trying to get better at that, but this was his idea and I've had so much trouble with this task, I thought it was a good solution. However, I get triggered easily when I ask and immediately get a response that makes it seem like a chore or too much trouble than it's worth. So that upset me.\n\nThen, before he left to pick the kids up on his scheduled day today, I asked him what he was going to do with the elves as a reminder. He asked me a few days ago what we should so with them this year, which I didn't understand. As far as we know, 11 still believes in Santa, so I didn't understand why we would do anything different and agreed that we should just have them out whenever they're with us like usual.\n\nWhen I reminded him today by asking what he was going to do he replied with \"I'll take them out in the morning\" which isn't what we always did and told him that and reminded him that we don't know that 11 doesn't believe so why would we change it now on likely her last year of believing. Then he said he didn't know where they are, and I told him about the very obvious place they were in that he couldn't miss. THEN he asked me where he should put them. I was pretty frustrated and said why do I need to be the one to decide this? I merely wanted to remind you to do this and that they're his kids and I really decide so many things here why couldn't he do that piece? We already discussed him doing their advent calendars (he decided not to because they aren't here much anymore) and the elves as well as figuring out gifts for his side of the family. I have already decorated and finished my shopping etc by now. \n\nI just want someone who will work with me rather than leaving all the decisions to me and for him to offer a nice compliment sometimes. Not once did he say any of it looked nice or that we did a good job or anything, and I purposefully asked him to take these responsibilities so I stop suffering from so much decision fatigue.\n\nI feel like I should have just agreed with him about the elves, but I did feel bad that this could be something that tips 11 off for her likely last season of believing. It was his task and I wanted to give up the control but I just thought of her. It literally took him 5 minutes and now I think he's pissed. \n\nWhen we do fight, I end up trying to discuss it and end up being the one in the wrong (which I am happy to share blame as it takes 2 to tango), but he always acts like he can never do anything right in my eyes. I have been sick for the last 3 weeks so even less patient than normal now that this has happened, but nothing I said was blaming him, but I did ask why all of this needs to be run by me??? I don't know what to do anymore. I love him, he's really great and totally understanding most of the time, but why am I the decision maker for everything when this is a life to be shared? How have any of you handled these types of issues?",

As far as we know, 11 still believes in Santa, so I didn&amp;#39;t understand why we would do anything different and agreed that we should just have them out whenever they&amp;#39;re with us like usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I reminded him today by asking what he was going to do he replied with &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take them out in the morning&amp;quot; which isn&amp;#39;t what we always did and told him that and reminded him that we don&amp;#39;t know that 11 doesn&amp;#39;t believe so why would we change it now on likely her last year of believing. Then he said he didn&amp;#39;t know where they are, and I told him about the very obvious place they were in that he couldn&amp;#39;t miss. THEN he asked me where he should put them. I was pretty frustrated and said why do I need to be the one to decide this? I merely wanted to remind you to do this and that they&amp;#39;re his kids and I really decide so many things here why couldn&amp;#39;t he do that piece? We already discussed him doing their advent calendars (he decided not to because they aren&amp;#39;t here much anymore) and the elves as well as figuring out gifts for his side of the family. I have already decorated and finished my shopping etc by now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want someone who will work with me rather than leaving all the decisions to me and for him to offer a nice compliment sometimes. Not once did he say any of it looked nice or that we did a good job or anything, and I purposefully asked him to take these responsibilities so I stop suffering from so much decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should have just agreed with him about the elves, but I did feel bad that this could be something that tips 11 off for her likely last season of believing. It was his task and I wanted to give up the control but I just thought of her. It literally took him 5 minutes and now I think he&amp;#39;s pissed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we do fight, I end up trying to discuss it and end up being the one in the wrong (which I am happy to share blame as it takes 2 to tango), but he always acts like he can never do anything right in my eyes. I have been sick for the last 3 weeks so even less patient than normal now that this has happened, but nothing I said was blaming him, but I did ask why all of this needs to be run by me??? I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I love him, he&amp;#39;s really great and totally understanding most of the time, but why am I the decision maker for everything when this is a life to be shared? How have any of you handled these types of issues?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019m very appreciated. \n\n\nI would like to add some info to the story and you can also find my bf counter opinion here in this post. \n\n\nFor  \u201cplate my own food first\u201d advice.\nYes, since I know he will literally eat every food even sharing items, I have stated to plate my part of the food first or tell him how much he is allowed to eat, or I will eat first and he will wait until i\u2019m done eating. It usually will solve the issue and everybody will have enough food for themselves. \n\nFor me doing this is already weird, because I think sharing the food and considering others when you are dining with someone are just normal basic etiquette. (that what I was taught growing up, and consider my Japanese culture background). \nMaking him wait like a dog watching me until I finish eating my part of the food is some thing I felt like it goes against my  moral beliefs. Also I might want take time to enjoy my food sometime\u2026..you know.\n\nHe is a nice man and I believe he just a simple person who will eat all food that in front of him without thinking anything, so I accepted who he is and willing to deal with this matter as people have mentioned, dividing the food or telling him what he is allowed to eat. Etc \n\nHowever there is situation that I cannot separate the food or I will forget to tell what is his part of food. \n\nIt\u2019s not about amount of he eat. The issue that I want to bring here is I don\u2019t like his attitude after I pointed out that he is the one has a problem and he should not get mad at me. \nI don\u2019t like it that he takes for granted\nor think it\u2019s my duty to divide and tell him what amount of the food he\u2019s allowed to eat. As most people have comment that leaving/sharing food with others when it\u2019s shareable items is basic etiquette and that is how you show consideration to others. He should be more apologetic rather getting mad at me.  \n\nMy purpose of the last post is to point out to him that majority of people out there, not only my personal thinking that sharing food with others is basics etiquette and it\u2019s weird that he cannot do it. He should have more consideration or be aware of his issue.\n\n\n***BELOW IS HIS COUNTER ARGUMENT *** \n\nSharing food is basic etiquette. There is, of course, some room for disagreement about the particulars. There are people who think everything should be 50/50. This may work for splitting rent, paying for vacations, etc. or it may not work. It depends on the situation. With the 4 nuggets, over the course of a 25 minute fast food meal consisting of 2 burgers, French fries, a salad and the 4 nuggets in question, one person (me) consumed 3 of the nuggets, the 3rd being absent-mindedly consumed around minute 15 of the meal. \n\nIt was a mistake that I immediately admitted, but I think the ensuing multi-hour argument (not joking) over the disposition of the erroneously eaten nugget proved my point: in a close relationship, there are deal-breakers that should cause a relationship to end\u2014not everyone should be a parent, some people should always be single\u2014but squabbling and refusing to talk to me for days (not joking) over a minor food issue? I feel like I\u2019m walking through a metaphorical minefield. When I communicated this to her, I believe she felt offended that I felt this way, as if she was doing something wrong, which I think she was. \n\nThis is not a situation of \u201cakrasia\u201d (great term for armchair psychologists out there, look it up). And as for \u201cweaponized incompetence,\u201d I know and personally appreciate how awful that is; I grew up with the adults in decision-making positions weirdly hypercompetent at feigning incompetence. It makes life worse for everybody around them and especially themselves. I\u2019m an OK cook, but she\u2019s great. The problem is whatever I cook isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s simple Western dishes like sausage and mashed potatoes, but if she doesn\u2019t like it to the point of bitterly complaining about it and refusing to eat it, I believe that is a reason not to prepare it. I always offer to wash the dishes\u2014she cooks, I clean. She rarely accepts, but I don\u2019t know what she is complaining about\u2014when I wash dishes and floors and toilets, they\u2019re all clean enough to eat off of. \n\nI also suggested plating the food separately and that largely solves the problem. But as several redditors here have surmised: there are other issues. She doesn\u2019t like my attitude. I admit to being direct, hopefully in a way that is honest but never intentionally hurtful. I willingly submit to changes like splitting food into clearly separate portions. She can eat more than me, it doesn\u2019t really bother me, I just don\u2019t want to think about it. For the same admittedly shallow reason Steve Jobs always wore black turtlenecks, I don\u2019t want to think much about what/how I am eating, day in, day out, I do it everyday. Decision fatigue at least partially explains my apparent inability to satisfy this person I really care about. Tell me exactly what to do, and I\u2019ll do it if I can. Tell me exactly what I\u2019m supposed to think, and I\u2019ll take issue with that if it is illogical, irrational or unsustainable.",

                    "selftext": "My Room mate and I have been friends for around 8 years before he moved in with us (Myself and my husband)  \nMy   Room mate has been getting angry at me lately because I got tons of   food that need to be cooked, and I was planning on cooking it. However   due to being short staffed the Taco Bell I work at now close at midnight   everyday. So in order for me to still get all my hours my boss has   changed my schedule from 8 PM - 4 AM every night to 5 Pm to 1 AM   every-night. That means I don't have time to cook anymore.  I think it   is important to know I went to college for a year and a half for   culinary arts.\n\nMy Room mate   refuses to cook because \"its to much energy\" or \"I don't have enough   Spoons\". So he started to get upset with me when I would come home and   still not want to cook.  Being passive aggressive and saying things like   \"We don't know what you had planned with the stuff.\" (I posted a link   to the menu of stuff I wanted to make and they have access to it). So   it's not like they can't make it themselves.\n\nSome more background in case more information is needed:  \nMy   Room mate has no Job, the only reason I let him live here is cause he   was in a very abusive household. So I wanted to get him out of it so he   could start growing as a person. I didn't expect him to get a job if  he  agreed to keep the apartment clean, that way he wouldn't have to  deal  with the stress of work right after getting out of a extremely  stressful  household. He has failed to do that and even get on my case  about not  \"loading the dishwasher correctly\". As well as complaining  about there  not being clean dishes at times when he wants to make a  sandwich or  something that doesn't require cooking.\n\nHe   also eats alot. I would buy sandwich stuff that would last my Husband   and myself the two weeks between paychecks and he would finish it by   himself with in three days. (for reference 2 loafs of bread and about   2-3 pounds of lunch meat and like 24 slices of cheese). Which has caused   some stress on our budget since we didn't expect that much food to be   gone so fast. He claims he makes so much since I won't cook and it is   very easy to make.\n\nI have offered   to teach him how to cook so he will be able to once he is able to be  out  on his own, and everytime I try to get him to join me he will say   something like \"I just don't have the energy right now\"\n\nI   said I would cook everyday before work (before they changed it to me   working at 5 PM). I really like cooking, but I don't have time to cook   before work now. Plus it will be way to early in the day for dinner and   lead to them eating later in the day anyway. So I just tell them to  make  something from the menu when they are hungry since I can't cook.  Which  they never do.\n\nSo in short, They are both  perfectly  capable of cooking just choose not to. I don't have the time  to cook  anymore before work, despite really wanting to.\n\nAdd on for this subreddit:  \nLike  I stated above, he doesn't do anything. He stays in his room 75% of the  time and plays video games while talking to his boyfriend. Admittedly  my Husband and Myself are bit of slobs and make messes. Not major  messes, just leaving plates and bowls around. My Room mate then gets on  us about not putting dishes up. Despite the fact he isn't the one that  ends of doing it, I am. He also agreed when we were discussing him  moving in with us that while my Husband and myself are the only ones  working he would do at least 90% of house work for his share of rent.  (the other 10% is my bedroom and clothes) So what should I do moving  forward? I am getting a bit fed up and had already talked to him about  how he seems to be doing very little to help out. I don't want to kick  him out since he was already in an abusive household and I have been  hoping he would attempt to grow in life. However he had been here about  5ish months already and done very little to attempt to grow up.  \n\n\nhe also claims he gets \"decision fatigue and Decision freeze\" when he has to make to many of his own choices. Which grinds my gears slightly because part of becoming an adult is having to decide things and do things on his own. He can't forever rely on other people to choose things for him. It can get overwhelming at time but he doesn't seem to want to learn any ways to cope. I have requested for him to seek therapy that I would pay for, so he can start to overcome his childhood trauma and work on being an independent adult, he has refused.  \n\n\nHe has also claimed that he has something called DiD presenting with alters and I refuse to believe that is true since it is pretty rare and he self diagnosed it. Which from my research is something someone can't do. So I have pushed for him to get therapy for this as well. Which he also refused. I feel like he is starting to mooch off of my husband and myself. Then whenever I confront him he claims it is causing him to much stress and going to trigger his mental illness. I don't know what to do going on from here.  \n\n\nNew Tl;Dr  \nI let my long time friend move in after learning he lived in an abusive household his whole life. Due to this he agreed that till his mental health improves he will keep the apartment clean for his side of rent. While my Husband and myself work full time. I said that is fine and I will teach him how to cook and cook for them before I head to my (previously overnight) job. However I started going to work way before I used to. Now he has been complaining about having nothing to eat when I get home other than bread. What do I do?  \n\n\nSorry if this post is all over the place.",

I (F31) met my current boyfriend (M32) a few years ago online but we actually didn't get together until early this year.  I was the pursuer in this relationship, as he is quite socially anxious and shy. That's fine with me, I'm a bit of an anxious mess myself in a different way. \n\nThis is my first serious relationship in about 6 years. I enjoyed single life thoroughly and have had encounters with all sorts of people and genders. On the other side of things I am so happy with him and our relationship. I'm so excited to celebrate our anniversary next year and he is the first person I told 'I love you' and actually feel like I have an idea of what it feels like.  He's the funniest person I've met, kind and witty. \n\nHowever, I come from a conflict-avoidant family. Growing up we never really got along, so I moved to the other side of the country and maintain a polite relationship with them. We never used to talk about our issues with each other, repressing them, bottling that shit up and throwing it far into the resentment ocean instead. Which is why I find the below so difficult. \n\nHere's what I need advice with:\n\nThere have been a few things with my boyfriend that have bothered me. As I said, he's quite shy and 'easy-going'. I thought at the start this would get better the more comfortable he becomes and it has gotten a lot better but only 8 months in, it seems he is quite happy to just be...passive? Most days I decide what we do, what we watch, what we eat. It begins to bother me that he's so compliant. Whenever I ask him what he would like to do for example, he replies with a question of what I want to do. It makes me feel like I am pulling all the weight at times and I get decision-fatigue if that makes sense. This also extends to the bedroom where it's the same routine every time we get down to it (even though it's good). For Christmas, we're wanting to visit my family across the country and we have some extra time on our hands. So I asked him if there is anything he'd like to do around my area and he just says we can do whatever I want to do. His lack of agency at times baffles me. I am worried he just complies to keep the peace and it makes me feel like a dictator without regard for his wishes. \n\nI'd like to let him know about this, in a constructive and helpful way. His past relationship was an abusive one and he gets anxious if there is only the hint of an argument on the horizon. How do I go about talking about this to him? What's the best way to let him know about my feelings without triggering his flight or fight response? We don't live together so do I give him a heads up that I want to talk? Do I just sit him down when I see him next?\n\nI'm so out of practice.  Y'all are always so good with framing things on here. Please help!",

I (F31) met my current boyfriend (M32) a few years ago online but we actually didn&amp;#39;t get together until early this year.  I was the pursuer in this relationship, as he is quite socially anxious and shy. That&amp;#39;s fine with me, I&amp;#39;m a bit of an anxious mess myself in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my first serious relationship in about 6 years. I enjoyed single life thoroughly and have had encounters with all sorts of people and genders. On the other side of things I am so happy with him and our relationship. I&amp;#39;m so excited to celebrate our anniversary next year and he is the first person I told &amp;#39;I love you&amp;#39; and actually feel like I have an idea of what it feels like.  He&amp;#39;s the funniest person I&amp;#39;ve met, kind and witty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I come from a conflict-avoidant family. Growing up we never really got along, so I moved to the other side of the country and maintain a polite relationship with them. We never used to talk about our issues with each other, repressing them, bottling that shit up and throwing it far into the resentment ocean instead. Which is why I find the below so difficult. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I need advice with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There have been a few things with my boyfriend that have bothered me. As I said, he&amp;#39;s quite shy and &amp;#39;easy-going&amp;#39;. I thought at the start this would get better the more comfortable he becomes and it has gotten a lot better but only 8 months in, it seems he is quite happy to just be...passive? Most days I decide what we do, what we watch, what we eat. It begins to bother me that he&amp;#39;s so compliant. Whenever I ask him what he would like to do for example, he replies with a question of what I want to do. It makes me feel like I am pulling all the weight at times and I get decision-fatigue if that makes sense. This also extends to the bedroom where it&amp;#39;s the same routine every time we get down to it (even though it&amp;#39;s good). For Christmas, we&amp;#39;re wanting to visit my family across the country and we have some extra time on our hands. So I asked him if there is anything he&amp;#39;d like to do around my area and he just says we can do whatever I want to do. His lack of agency at times baffles me. I am worried he just complies to keep the peace and it makes me feel like a dictator without regard for his wishes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to let him know about this, in a constructive and helpful way. His past relationship was an abusive one and he gets anxious if there is only the hint of an argument on the horizon. How do I go about talking about this to him? What&amp;#39;s the best way to let him know about my feelings without triggering his flight or fight response? We don&amp;#39;t live together so do I give him a heads up that I want to talk? Do I just sit him down when I see him next?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so out of practice.  Y&amp;#39;all are always so good with framing things on here. Please help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He has had female best friends throughout our relationship, and likes to hang out with them 1-on-1 now more often than ever before. Additionally, he's told me that he knows I love him, but he doesn't feel the love through my words or actions. He says there is something missing in our relationship, but can\u2019t pinpoint what it is. I'm devastated, as I thought our relationship had issues but that we\u2019d be able to work through them, and I continue to think that I'm at fault for all that's wrong with our relationship. I can\u2019t make him happy like his female friends can. How can I determine if I should try to change my mindset (regarding his female friends) and push to keep our relationship, or leave and find happiness on my own?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe long version...\n\nMy (32F) Background:\n\nI can be a work-a-holic. I'm in an industry that is very demanding on my time, and I need to make decisions all throughout the work day. Some days I hit decision fatigue and I can't handle making small, minor decisions at home. I also have a hard time knowing what I want at any given point - I'm very much a facilitator of good times, so I don't care what we do so long as the people involved are having fun. I dislike confrontation, and I tend to keep things bottled up inside, especially if things bother me. I am very good at enduring. I\u2019m not very good at opening up and talking to people.\n\nHis (37M) Background:\n\nMy boyfriend is a genius and excels at all that he does. He\u2019s talented, athletic, charismatic, and quick to analyze and come to a decision in any given situation. He works hard, and is a perfectionist in much of what he does. He\u2019s very critical of things and people/friends, including me and my thoughts/actions. He has great willpower in some cases, and very little willpower in others (like when he has female friends that want to spend time with him). He tends to make strong emotional connections with women, and has been doing so for much of his life. He wants to live a life of integrity, which leads to honesty in all situations, and can cause some friction when in polite company or can lead to revealing feelings between him and his female friends. \n\nHe and I have been dating for almost 10 years at this point. I know him pretty well, and I can anticipate some of his feelings and actions, but he\u2019s told me that he feels like I still don\u2019t know him very well even after all these years. I think he expects me to read his mind, and it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nRecently he made a new female friend (24F). They started hanging out a lot a few months ago, including texting throughout the day and playing videos games together at night. They still hang out to this day, but the frequency has been limited per my request. When we talk about his new friendship, he told me that this is the same way he\u2019s interacted with other women in the past (during our relationship), and he doesn\u2019t understand why this friendship is so triggering to me. He\u2019s also told me that they\u2019ve been honest about their feelings for each other \u2013 she is interested in dating him, and he\u2019s probably interested too, but isn\u2019t willing to leave me for her. I have been very accommodating to his female friends in the past, but I think I was na\u00efve in what those friendships actually were \u2013 he was finding the \u201cmissing thing\u201d in our relationship through his friendships with other women. And he really enjoys being around women that like him.\n\nAt the height of his close friendships, he would ask me if he could cuddle his female friends. He asked to cuddle with his most recent friend (24F) a month or so ago. And I said yes. I always say yes, because I want him to be happy, but that kind of thing really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. It seems like a sort of \u201cliving with integrity\u201d on his part because he asked permission first, and I\u2019m such a push over that of course I wouldn\u2019t deny him this. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019m feeling betrayed, manipulated, and na\u00efve about what our relationship really is. I don\u2019t think I can ever make him happy, not without giving in to his want for female friends and physical contact with them. And I think I need to start acting and doing things that align with my intrinsic values, which don\u2019t include sharing my significant other with other women. But damn, I do love him.\n\nI\u2019m looking for advice on what strategies I could try to get over this unease of his female friends, or input on if it\u2019s worth continuing to fight for this relationship. Has anyone had significant others that spend a large amount of time with best friends of the opposite/interested sex? Has anyone been in this kind of situation and pulled through with the relationship in tact?",

He\u2019s also told me that they\u2019ve been honest about their feelings for each other \u2013 she is interested in dating him, and he\u2019s probably interested too, but isn\u2019t willing to leave me for her. I have been very accommodating to his female friends in the past, but I think I was na\u00efve in what those friendships actually were \u2013 he was finding the \u201cmissing thing\u201d in our relationship through his friendships with other women. And he really enjoys being around women that like him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the height of his close friendships, he would ask me if he could cuddle his female friends. He asked to cuddle with his most recent friend (24F) a month or so ago. And I said yes. I always say yes, because I want him to be happy, but that kind of thing really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. It seems like a sort of \u201cliving with integrity\u201d on his part because he asked permission first, and I\u2019m such a push over that of course I wouldn\u2019t deny him this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I\u2019m feeling betrayed, manipulated, and na\u00efve about what our relationship really is. I don\u2019t think I can ever make him happy, not without giving in to his want for female friends and physical contact with them. And I think I need to start acting and doing things that align with my intrinsic values, which don\u2019t include sharing my significant other with other women. But damn, I do love him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m looking for advice on what strategies I could try to get over this unease of his female friends, or input on if it\u2019s worth continuing to fight for this relationship. Has anyone had significant others that spend a large amount of time with best friends of the opposite/interested sex? Has anyone been in this kind of situation and pulled through with the relationship in tact?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
