Below is a semi stream of consciousness rant that I captured yesterday with the hopes of maybe presenting it to a therapist or something. I found it kind of interesting so just thought I'd share, any thoughts are appreciated.\n\n&gt; *Saturday morning panic - I wake up on the weekend and freak out because I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.  With no work to go to I don\u2019t have an activity pulling me in a direction.  I think about all the things I could do, all the things I should do, all the people I could reach out to to see what they\u2019re up to and if they want to do anything with me, but I inevitably get decision fatigue/decision lock and can\u2019t figure out what to do.  This just keeps increasing in intensity until a) something happens that I can go latch onto, or b) I force myself to just go take a walk or do something on the list that breaks the cycle.  I\u2019m experiencing this panic train of thought right now so let me go into detail:  It\u2019s a beautiful Saturday outside and I am wasting my free time because I can\u2019t decide what to do, this is making me angry at myself.  My first thought when I woke up was to go for a hike because it\u2019s so nice out.  My second thought was, who should I go with (more aptly, who would want to go with me?)  I\u2019m not sure about that, which results in its own failed decision tree.  I\u2019d probably like to go with Savannah because she likes hiking and we get along, but I keep thinking of reasons it\u2019s not going to work out, all fears and doubts.  Is that what I really want to/should be doing?  Would she even want to go?  I\u2019m worried about my car, it really needs an oil change, should I be driving it to the gorge?    At this point I\u2019m wondering if my writing is ok and my instinct is to go back and re-read everything I\u2019ve just written and make sure it sounds right, and I almost did, and compulsively want to, but I\u2019m pressing on because that\u2019s not the right thing to do right now and I\u2019ll lose my train of thought (***this is its own problem - I lose my train of thought all the time because I overthink/overevaluate everything)  Fuck!  Anyway - then I think about getting my oil changed, and should I do that today or another day, but then I can\u2019t drive anywhere, and what mechanic should I go to and how much does it cost and when can I drop off/pickup my car and how does that work with my schedule.  And so I figure all that shit out, sort of, I have the information, but I\u2019m still not sure what to do.  I mean, I still want to go on a hike, but I have to shower and then probably get food and what should I eat?  I don\u2019t have much at home so I\u2019d have to go get something, but what?  My diet is so restrictive because my stomach is fucked up.  So making food decisions is a constant struggle in itself.  Just the basic act of eating, seriously.  At this point I\u2019m really hungry so I just eat a ton of cheese and crackers.  Nobody is really doing anything.  I think about all the other stuff I need to do - clean the house, finish unpacking stuff from when we moved a month and a half ago, do laundry, take a shower, fuck my back hurts I really need to stretch and shop for a mattress and pay bills and update my credit card for all my auto pay stuff because there was fraud on my card the other day and I had to get a new one and I now have to poop.  So I do that and I\u2019m like \u201cwell I\u2019m already in the bathroom, I should just shower now\u201d which is purely a lowest effort decision.  Then I get dressed and by now hours have passed and it\u2019s afternoon and I still don\u2019t know what to do with my day and there\u2019s 20 things swimming around in my head of what I need to/want to do and I can\u2019t make a decision and my angst/anxiety is building and building to to fever pitch and at this point I don\u2019t want to do any of them and just want to be free of decisions and be outside somewhere enjoying the sun.   And now finally Alex is like \u201chey wanna get some food/drink\u201d and I now have something to do that will free me from this mental prison.  The End, not really.*",

Then I get dressed and by now hours have passed and it\u2019s afternoon and I still don\u2019t know what to do with my day and there\u2019s 20 things swimming around in my head of what I need to/want to do and I can\u2019t make a decision and my angst/anxiety is building and building to to fever pitch and at this point I don\u2019t want to do any of them and just want to be free of decisions and be outside somewhere enjoying the sun.   And now finally Alex is like \u201chey wanna get some food/drink\u201d and I now have something to do that will free me from this mental prison.  The End, not really.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
