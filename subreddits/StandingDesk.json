I've put multiple desks or frames into carts and started the checkout process only to go back to check \"1 more thing\" and get stuck in the confusion again. Please, someone push me over the tipping point for something.\n\n**Context and obstacles:**\n\nI had an Ikea electric sit/stand desk before, and for my first sit/stand desk and for the price I got it for, it was fine. But I recently moved from LA to Chicago and and couldn't take it with me. Figured it's time for an upgrade, too.\n\nMy setup: two 25\" monitors (on stands, but would like to put them on pneumatic arms), 2 laptops (on pneumatic arms), a desktop mic, and sometimes a cat.\n\nIn a perfect world I'd find a top between 50\" - 55\" wide (I'm worried a 48\" desktop will be a teensy bit too small, and 60\" would be a tight fit in my apartment) and 28\" - 30\" deep.\n\nI'm 5'3\", so I think I need a desk that goes lower than 27\". But if I use a keyboard tray, would 27\" would be fine?\n\nI'm reeeaaaally trying to keep the total cost for everything around/under $600. I understand that you get what you pay for and I should invest in a good desk because I work at it all day and I don't want it to break down in a year or two, but I just can't spend much more than that right now (unless there's an awesome financing option and it's actually worth the extra money).\n\nI'd love a white base, but I can be open to a different color base if there's a good deal or a convincing enough reason to do so.\n\nI need a programmable switch (it may sound silly, but it's a dealbreaker for me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Past, minimalist set-up \\(laptops are now on a dual arm and my desk has accumulated a lot more crap\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wtvhg1j511z61.png?width=2078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fefd55297b6d051e8f5262ab2da3db18f379bfb6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[He's long \\(and even bigger now\\).](https://preview.redd.it/c0e6eo5i11z61.png?width=2520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47376bba7c69e48cb9d039d20416f0c022c049cb)\n\n**The options keeping me up at night:**\n\nbtod Vert3 - 55\" x 30\" top with a white frame for $675 (on sale through 5/17), and apparently a lifetime warranty? It's over budget, but for a 55\" desk size, it might be worth spending a bit more. The only thing is the lowest height setting is 27\".\n\n[desk.haus](https://desk.haus) Apex 2-leg, white, extended range frame for $446 (plus $100-$200 for a top), but how does this compare stability wise to the other options? Should I just spend the extra money on a (maybe?) sturdier frame? Or because I'm short and won't ever set it to max height, the Apex will more than stable enough for me? Also, a bummer on the lead time (I'm working off a Costco folding table right now), but the price is so good it might be worth waiting for.\n\n[desk.haus](https://desk.haus) Vertex 2-leg, white, extended range frame with the programmable switch for $596 (plus $100-$200 for a top). It'll put me over budget with the top, but is it worth the extra $150 over the Apex? In u/ilikeputz's buying guide, he said this was his go-to recommendation when people ask about stability.\n\nVaridesk 48\" x 30\" for $505 ( it's normally $595, but I think I can get 15% cashback through the end of the week if I buy it at [Officemax.com](https://Officemax.com) and use the Rakuten browser extension). Apparently it's SUPER easy to put together, which is definitely attractive to me, but they only make a gray base and a 48\" or 60\" top.\n\nLinak DF2 frame with the programmable switch is on sale at [ergotables.com](https://ergotables.com) for $420 (plus $100-$200 for a top), but I feel like I'd rather buy the Apex 2 through [desk.haus](https://desk.haus) for about the same price unless this is way more stable?\n\nI'm not really interested in an Uplift or Fully Jarvis since they're more expensive and don't seem to offer anything more than a brand name for that extra money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo can someone please just kick me in the right direction or at least help me eliminate a choice? I'm exhausted.",

I&amp;#39;ve put multiple desks or frames into carts and started the checkout process only to go back to check &amp;quot;1 more thing&amp;quot; and get stuck in the confusion again. Please, someone push me over the tipping point for something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context and obstacles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an Ikea electric sit/stand desk before, and for my first sit/stand desk and for the price I got it for, it was fine. But I recently moved from LA to Chicago and and couldn&amp;#39;t take it with me. Figured it&amp;#39;s time for an upgrade, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My setup: two 25&amp;quot; monitors (on stands, but would like to put them on pneumatic arms), 2 laptops (on pneumatic arms), a desktop mic, and sometimes a cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world I&amp;#39;d find a top between 50&amp;quot; - 55&amp;quot; wide (I&amp;#39;m worried a 48&amp;quot; desktop will be a teensy bit too small, and 60&amp;quot; would be a tight fit in my apartment) and 28&amp;quot; - 30&amp;quot; deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;3&amp;quot;, so I think I need a desk that goes lower than 27&amp;quot;. But if I use a keyboard tray, would 27&amp;quot; would be fine?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reeeaaaally trying to keep the total cost for everything around/under $600. I understand that you get what you pay for and I should invest in a good desk because I work at it all day and I don&amp;#39;t want it to break down in a year or two, but I just can&amp;#39;t spend much more than that right now (unless there&amp;#39;s an awesome financing option and it&amp;#39;s actually worth the extra money).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love a white base, but I can be open to a different color base if there&amp;#39;s a good deal or a convincing enough reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need a programmable switch (it may sound silly, but it&amp;#39;s a dealbreaker for me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wtvhg1j511z61.png?width=2078&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fefd55297b6d051e8f5262ab2da3db18f379bfb6\"&gt;Past, minimalist set-up (laptops are now on a dual arm and my desk has accumulated a lot more crap)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c0e6eo5i11z61.png?width=2520&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=47376bba7c69e48cb9d039d20416f0c022c049cb\"&gt;He&amp;#39;s long (and even bigger now).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The options keeping me up at night:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;btod Vert3 - 55&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; top with a white frame for $675 (on sale through 5/17), and apparently a lifetime warranty? It&amp;#39;s over budget, but for a 55&amp;quot; desk size, it might be worth spending a bit more. The only thing is the lowest height setting is 27&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://desk.haus\"&gt;desk.haus&lt;/a&gt; Apex 2-leg, white, extended range frame for $446 (plus $100-$200 for a top), but how does this compare stability wise to the other options? Should I just spend the extra money on a (maybe?) sturdier frame? Or because I&amp;#39;m short and won&amp;#39;t ever set it to max height, the Apex will more than stable enough for me? Also, a bummer on the lead time (I&amp;#39;m working off a Costco folding table right now), but the price is so good it might be worth waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://desk.haus\"&gt;desk.haus&lt;/a&gt; Vertex 2-leg, white, extended range frame with the programmable switch for $596 (plus $100-$200 for a top). It&amp;#39;ll put me over budget with the top, but is it worth the extra $150 over the Apex? In &lt;a href=\"/u/ilikeputz\"&gt;u/ilikeputz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s buying guide, he said this was his go-to recommendation when people ask about stability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Varidesk 48&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; for $505 ( it&amp;#39;s normally $595, but I think I can get 15% cashback through the end of the week if I buy it at &lt;a href=\"https://Officemax.com\"&gt;Officemax.com&lt;/a&gt; and use the Rakuten browser extension). Apparently it&amp;#39;s SUPER easy to put together, which is definitely attractive to me, but they only make a gray base and a 48&amp;quot; or 60&amp;quot; top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Linak DF2 frame with the programmable switch is on sale at &lt;a href=\"https://ergotables.com\"&gt;ergotables.com&lt;/a&gt; for $420 (plus $100-$200 for a top), but I feel like I&amp;#39;d rather buy the Apex 2 through &lt;a href=\"https://desk.haus\"&gt;desk.haus&lt;/a&gt; for about the same price unless this is way more stable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really interested in an Uplift or Fully Jarvis since they&amp;#39;re more expensive and don&amp;#39;t seem to offer anything more than a brand name for that extra money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So can someone please just kick me in the right direction or at least help me eliminate a choice? I&amp;#39;m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have put myself in a bit of a mental pretzel with all of the research that I have done, but here is some background on what I will need out of the desk:\n\n* Looking for a frame only as I plan on getting a 72x25in butchers block for the tabletop\n* I have 3 monitors on a single vesa mount and they are aligned side by side in landscape orientation.\n* I absolutely hate visible cables. The dream would be to only have a single cable coming from the desk and that is it. So out of necessity the PC would have to sit on the tabletop.\n* Will be used for work as well as gaming\n\nSo far, I have got it down to two different desks: Apex Pro 4 Leg and the Jarvis.\n\nStarting with the Apex as its the one that i like more. The frame looks extremely stable, to the point where i have no doubt it could easily handle the 3 monitors on one mount with a reasonable amount of wobble. Cons on the other hand is that it is understandably pricey, the fair amount of cables already under the desk due to the 4 individual motors, and all sales being final for the desk. Additionally, I will be moving in \\~3-4 months and it looks like it is going to be more difficult to move. \n\nAs for the Jarvis, it is significantly cheaper and still looks like it has some fairly reasonable build quality. What is giving me pause is that with the weight of the 3 monitors on a single mount as well as the PC it will be probably get fairly wobbly fairly quickly. \n\nWhat I am hoping to gain by posting this is some insights on each desk, insights on owning a standing desk in general, or recommendations on other desks if you are a sadist and would like my decision fatigue to get worse! \n\nThanks.",

I have put myself in a bit of a mental pretzel with all of the research that I have done, but here is some background on what I will need out of the desk:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Looking for a frame only as I plan on getting a 72x25in butchers block for the tabletop&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have 3 monitors on a single vesa mount and they are aligned side by side in landscape orientation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I absolutely hate visible cables. The dream would be to only have a single cable coming from the desk and that is it. So out of necessity the PC would have to sit on the tabletop.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Will be used for work as well as gaming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, I have got it down to two different desks: Apex Pro 4 Leg and the Jarvis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with the Apex as its the one that i like more. The frame looks extremely stable, to the point where i have no doubt it could easily handle the 3 monitors on one mount with a reasonable amount of wobble. Cons on the other hand is that it is understandably pricey, the fair amount of cables already under the desk due to the 4 individual motors, and all sales being final for the desk. Additionally, I will be moving in ~3-4 months and it looks like it is going to be more difficult to move. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the Jarvis, it is significantly cheaper and still looks like it has some fairly reasonable build quality. What is giving me pause is that with the weight of the 3 monitors on a single mount as well as the PC it will be probably get fairly wobbly fairly quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I am hoping to gain by posting this is some insights on each desk, insights on owning a standing desk in general, or recommendations on other desks if you are a sadist and would like my decision fatigue to get worse! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
