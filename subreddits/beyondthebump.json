I have the nuna Pipa RX car seat so I\u2019m debating between the TRIV and the MIXX. \n\nWhat I like about the mixx is that the seat lays flat to a bassinet so you don\u2019t have to use the infant car seat every time, has bigger wheels and basket, better suspension. Cons, it\u2019s heavy. \n\nWhat I like about the triv is that it\u2019s 11 pounds lighter, and one handed fold. But it requires the infant car seat until baby is big enough for the regular seat. \n\nOther info, once baby is about 8-9 months old primary caregiver will likely be my MIL who\u2019s in her early 70s. Live in the suburbs but we like to hike at nearby parks with wooded trails but won\u2019t likely do so until spring. \n\nAnyone have experience with one or both? I feel like I have decision fatigue and just can\u2019t make up my mind. ",

I have the nuna Pipa RX car seat so I\u2019m debating between the TRIV and the MIXX. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I like about the mixx is that the seat lays flat to a bassinet so you don\u2019t have to use the infant car seat every time, has bigger wheels and basket, better suspension. Cons, it\u2019s heavy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I like about the triv is that it\u2019s 11 pounds lighter, and one handed fold. But it requires the infant car seat until baby is big enough for the regular seat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other info, once baby is about 8-9 months old primary caregiver will likely be my MIL who\u2019s in her early 70s. Live in the suburbs but we like to hike at nearby parks with wooded trails but won\u2019t likely do so until spring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone have experience with one or both? I feel like I have decision fatigue and just can\u2019t make up my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I also make sure to get out of the house every day, even if just for a walk around the neighborhood.\n\nBut I am feeling depressed again\u2026I am not getting good sleep because the baby wakes up at least 1-2x per night. The first time, I respond with a feed. Subsequent times my husband rocks him back to sleep. I know this is all biological normal, but I feel like I can\u2019t keep running on broken sleep\u2026how does everyone function like this?\n\nI\u2019m also struggling with the thought of just putting the baby in daycare. But I don\u2019t want to because I will feel like I\u2019m neglecting him. We breastfeed exclusively so I don\u2019t want to have to pump and clean supplies every freaking day. Two days a week is enough for the pumping. I know breastfeeding is probably making my hormones crazy, but I want to stop when my baby is ready. My plan is to wean to cows milk in the daytime after one year, but keep night breastfeeding until he weans.\n\nUgh I just feel like the fatigue and decision fatigue (I handle all of the baby\u2019s food and 99% of his care at home) is really getting to me. I\u2019m having thoughts like I was I would have never had a baby. And he\u2019s a good baby, but I feel like I\u2019m not cut out for this.\nI just wanted to be a SAHM for two years and then get him into daycare when I know he\u2019ll be weaned from breastfeeding and ready for more socialization. But I feel like I can\u2019t handle another year of this life!! Sometimes I just wish my baby could talk and tell me what he wants. I just wish he could be an older kid and everything wouldn\u2019t be a fight and struggle (diaper changes, brushing teeth, literally everything he doesn\u2019t want to do is a meltdown).\n\nI know every stage is hard and different, but maybe I\u2019m better cut out for toddler hard and not baby hard? The fatigue is what is getting me down the most. Please tell me it gets better.\n\nEdited to add: I also am feeling down about my relationship with my husband. I am all-consumed by baby care and there is no time left to foster my relationship with my husband. We have not had sex for a full year. By the time baby goes to bed (8ish) I am exhausted and just crash. Then he\u2019s up at 5:30-6am so I just don\u2019t see how I can have time and energy for my husband. He\u2019s understanding, but it\u2019s depressing me.",

He also breastfeeds before naps (1-2 a day) but doesn\u2019t nurse long before falling asleep so it doesn\u2019t seem like he is getting a substantial amount of milk during these times. He also nurses to sleep and off and on throughout the night so I\u2019m thinking this is when he gets the majority of his  milk intake. \n* He has 6 teeth and seems to be getting molars. He has been incredibly crabby lately and reaching milestones which I know could mean he is in a leap. But I have really tried to stop checking my Wonder Weeks app because sometimes I feel like it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy\n\nProblem: Is he getting enough to eat/getting the nutrition he needs every day? He barely eats anything, really doesn\u2019t like to try many new things, but will eat certain things always (Yumi superfood bars, Annie\u2019s Hidden Veggie Crackers, Cheerios, Once Upon a Farm pouch, Serenity Kids Puffs) but these things aren\u2019t meals. I know it takes many exposures to the same foods for toddlers to truly determine if they like it or not but he hardly tries new things, and I don\u2019t want to shove it into his mouth unwillingly.\n\nI am reading that it helps to serve them 3 different foods - one they sometimes like, one they always like, and one new one/one they don\u2019t like. But what do you do when your baby only eats the one food they like and throws/ignores the other food? Do you offer them something else? Should I be giving him cow\u2019s milk for the nutritional value it has? I have held off on giving him any because he is just now overcoming some constipation issues, and I figured cows milk would make that worse.\n\nJust an example - breakfast today was a Kodiak cub waffle and a fried egg. Ate 1/2 of the waffle and MAYBE 1/4 of the egg. Became restless and shaking his head, so we got out of the high chair and, while playing on the floor, I offered pieces of a Yumi superfood bar, and he ate the entire thing. So he is still hungry, right? How do I know I\u2019m not starving my kid? Obviously kiddos usually cry when they are hungry but I don\u2019t ever want it to (and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not healthy) to let it get that far.\n\nBetween my anxiety and major decision fatigue, my mental health is dwindling after I\u2019ve felt like I made a huge comeback. (I do make foods/sauces and freeze them to make food decisions a bit easier.) \n\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Did it change? Is this normal? How do I stop feeling like I am failing?\n\nIf you read through this, thank you - you\u2019re a saint!",
