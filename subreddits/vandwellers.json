Once to destination, I'd stay at campground or state park to set up shop for the week, explore the community scene, restaurants, etc. Weekends I would explore the nearby recreation dabbling with boondocking over the 3 day weekend (while also dabbling with my internet capabilities to see if they can handle the demands of job-in case i like boondocking and want to transition to working there).

But how do you find van life works with or against your ADHD?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have ADHD, not the worst case of it but not mild either, and the idea of simple living / minimalism etc appeals to me, I think it would help me not having to always trying to keep an entire house and garden clean / tidy and well kept (I&amp;#39;d still clean in the van but obviously its not as big and less stuff to worry about).   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I wonder if the constant having to make decisions of where to park / sleep, do I have enough water, do I have enough electricity in the batteries, would grind me down and become too much and decision fatigue would me miserable? Like Im not happy in my current life situation living in a house and looking for a change but atleast here Im not worried about finding water or where Im going to sleep tonight. Just looking for thoughts / experiences &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
