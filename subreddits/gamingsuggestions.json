It might have been by design choice or technological constraints, but I prefer a game that doesn't ask me to make too many decisions. \n\nSeriously a lot of these open world games just cause me decision fatigue, for example compare MGSV ground zeroes vs the phantom pain. The first for me felt awesome, it was a contained area and you could be a completionist and a perfectionist without too much pain. Try such a playing style on the other one however, and for me personally I went crazy. It felt like work and there was little joy in the whole experience. \n\nBottom line: could you suggest a third person game with somewhat of a linear storyline and that does not go crazy with the side quests, stats, areas that you can go into but have higher level monsters than you so you shouldn't hangout much in...... that kinda crap.",

It might have been by design choice or technological constraints, but I prefer a game that doesn&amp;#39;t ask me to make too many decisions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously a lot of these open world games just cause me decision fatigue, for example compare MGSV ground zeroes vs the phantom pain. The first for me felt awesome, it was a contained area and you could be a completionist and a perfectionist without too much pain. Try such a playing style on the other one however, and for me personally I went crazy. It felt like work and there was little joy in the whole experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: could you suggest a third person game with somewhat of a linear storyline and that does not go crazy with the side quests, stats, areas that you can go into but have higher level monsters than you so you shouldn&amp;#39;t hangout much in...... that kinda crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Currently looking for things I can play on my laptop in bed (Win 10/4k/GTX 950M/XB1 Elite controller). I mainly just stick to Steam and what is on there, especially if I have to buy, but I'm keeping an open mind here.  \n  \nI've got a list of around a hundred games or so that looked good that I've found recently, got them all bookmarked for later. But instead of just picking something I keep looking up new games and adding them to the list and getting depressed when I spend all night looking for something to play and going to bed without playing anything. I don't know what's wrong with, maybe it's part decision fatigue, part wanting to find the perfect game to justify the time spent playing it. Sometimes it seems like maybe a game is very long, and I'm not sure I have enough time to get into, or the game is really short and I don't want to play it and have it leaving me wanting more. Even just writing this is making me annoyed with myself, I need to just pick something and go already.\n\nCan anyone suggest something that can help me, or recommend a game that will captivate me from the first moment?  \n\nPriorities: Great stories or no story at all, slow thought-provoking or deep gameplay or mindless frustratingly fast twitchy gameplay, realistic or unusual settings, japanese shit, mysteriousness\n\nDon't care/don't want: Super realistic or really amatuer graphics, beat-to-death settings (if it has orcs or elves I'm probably not even gonna give it a second thought), formulaic or repetitive gameplay (static instead of dynamic), mediocre stories to sit through, visual novels (I actually really like VNs but they don't satisfy gaming urges at all so not looking for recs there), anything that you have to consult youtube videos or a wiki just to play",

Currently looking for things I can play on my laptop in bed (Win 10/4k/GTX 950M/XB1 Elite controller). I mainly just stick to Steam and what is on there, especially if I have to buy, but I&amp;#39;m keeping an open mind here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a list of around a hundred games or so that looked good that I&amp;#39;ve found recently, got them all bookmarked for later. But instead of just picking something I keep looking up new games and adding them to the list and getting depressed when I spend all night looking for something to play and going to bed without playing anything. I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with, maybe it&amp;#39;s part decision fatigue, part wanting to find the perfect game to justify the time spent playing it. Sometimes it seems like maybe a game is very long, and I&amp;#39;m not sure I have enough time to get into, or the game is really short and I don&amp;#39;t want to play it and have it leaving me wanting more. Even just writing this is making me annoyed with myself, I need to just pick something and go already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone suggest something that can help me, or recommend a game that will captivate me from the first moment?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priorities: Great stories or no story at all, slow thought-provoking or deep gameplay or mindless frustratingly fast twitchy gameplay, realistic or unusual settings, japanese shit, mysteriousness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t care/don&amp;#39;t want: Super realistic or really amatuer graphics, beat-to-death settings (if it has orcs or elves I&amp;#39;m probably not even gonna give it a second thought), formulaic or repetitive gameplay (static instead of dynamic), mediocre stories to sit through, visual novels (I actually really like VNs but they don&amp;#39;t satisfy gaming urges at all so not looking for recs there), anything that you have to consult youtube videos or a wiki just to play&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
