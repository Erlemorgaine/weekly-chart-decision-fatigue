I've heard people say those aren't safe or good for their physical development so we're not going to do those but I might get a little activity center for him to play with. There's two Skip Hop centers and two Fisher Price centers I'm considering. They all have pros and cons. Some turn into toddler tables, some have music, some have toys that look better. These are the 4 I'm considering:\n\nSkip Hop Round (music, turns into table, toys look meh)  https://a.co/d/3Famz31\n\nSkip Hop Square (no music, turns into table, toys look decent) https://a.co/d/1rz2SKd\n\nFisher Price Snugapuppy (music, toys look good) https://a.co/d/ebI0FdX\n\nFisher Price Like A Boss (claims to teach, no music, toys look good) https://a.co/d/ap44BN6\n\nAny opinions or experiences with these toys would be appreciated because I just don't know and I've got decision fatigue\n\nEdit: links\n\nEdit: I've taken all of your comments into consideration and I've found the Cloud Island Skip Hop like new on Facebook for half the price, so I'm going to pick that up in a few hours.

At some point soon I\u2019d also like to get a foam mat, same goals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of going down the research rabbit hole I\u2019m sure many of you are familiar with each time I need to buy something, it would be great if there is an online shop that only chooses to stock things they\u2019re confident in, or a brand for toys I can get at Baby Bunting or local shops, so I can just buy stuff without the decision fatigue.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m on the Central Coast (NSW), and not really up for driving into Sydney for a specific store, but if it\u2019s a tiny world and you happen to know a local shop, that\u2019s great too!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
