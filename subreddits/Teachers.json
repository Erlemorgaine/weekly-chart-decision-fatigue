I\u2019m sure we can all think of ways that we\u2019ve consciously or unconsciously come up with systems, procedures, or policies that have either eliminated or limited choices to make things easier. Maybe we can share some examples in hopes of making our lives a little less exhausting. \n\n\u2022 I meal prep salads for the week on Sunday so I don\u2019t have to think about what I want in the morning. \n\n\u2022 I top off my gas every Sunday when I go out for salad veggies. This allows me to totally avoid the mental gymnastics of deciding if I have time to get gas in the morning or enough to get me to work and then to a gas station after work, or the \u201cI\u2019m so tired! I\u2019ll just get it in the morning. \ud83d\ude15\u201d\n\n\u2022 I encourage kids to go to the bathroom as they come into class. I\u2019d rather they put their books down and be 3 minutes late than ask to go in the middle of the lesson. \n\n\u2022 I follow 98% of the school policies so I don\u2019t have to make judgment calls. It\u2019s just easier for me\u2026 but if everyone in the building followed them it would also be easier on the kids not having to remember what the Spanish teacher allows vs what the math teacher allows. (This only works if you work in a school with comprehensive policies \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nWhat ways have you come up with avoid decisions or eliminate choices?",

Often it is true we make so many little adaptations and choices throughout the day it really is mentally exhausting even on days when we may be sitting down a great deal of the day.  I have proactively looking how to get what I want in my life by making as little decisions as possible and it is amazing to see how much I can get done without  feeling as burnt out and overwhelmed as I used to.\n\nFor example, I have basically a uniform I wear every day.  I have 5 pairs of black slacks to go with everything and a set of blouses that I can just grab.  The most choice I make is if I feel like long sleeve or short sleeve or if I feel a strong preference for color on a day.  I deffered the daily choice of choosing what to wear to when I go shopping.  Again for lunch, I get a selection of 5 different flavors of salad and just grab one a day to be part of a lunch that has the same components every day.   \n\nThis was my basic running mode, but this year I actively looked for opportunities to decisions.  Getting to the gym is hard enough, but then you have to decide what to do and how many and that is way to much for me to focus on.  I have an app Activetrax that tells me what excersize to do, the weight, and the repetitions.  It knows when it is leg day or chest day and I have no idea until I get there.  Many less decisions, but more health!\n\nThe most recent edition to my routines is dinner.  I used to eat out at the end of the day because to decide what to buy make sure it didn't go bad and somesuch was too much.  I have been using the app Eat This Much for the last 3 weeks and it allows me to set a whole week of meals and creates a grocery list and pantry list for me and take into account trying to use up leftovers or creating leftovers from meals.  I have not wanted to eat out because I am excited to come home and cook since I know everything is there.\n\nAll of this leaves me more energy to make educational decisions for my students and feel like I have a fulfilling balanced home life.",

He wants to add football coach to that next year. \n\nI'm a SAHM of a 3yo and 5mo old. Our 5-month-old was born 10 weeks early 2 months into the school year, so he had a rocky first year being a teacher. \n\nBy the time he comes home, he can barely keep his eyes awake, and this has created a huge point of contention in our life because I have to break down in tears for slow change to happen. \n\nBut as I have locked myself in the bathroom to just decompress from my stress, I'm wondering how I can re-evaluate and be more supportive and understanding of the fact that we are both bombarded by small children all day and experience decision fatigue and want to be left alone. \n\nI usually cave and just keep being the default parent. But I'm at my wit's end. How do I demand the support I need when I'm demanding that support from a teacher and breadwinner? I don't want to invalidate his stress, but it feels like I have to invalidate my own. \n\nI'm starting to ramble, so just what am I supposed to do?\n\nI realize I'm asking more teachers for help, so I'm sorry \ud83d\udc94 \n\nEdit to add: yes we need the extra money from coaching, the coaching does not overlap, it\u2019s girls bball, then boys, and then track. I could secure a job tomorrow at the daycare I worked at last year if he will agree to drive us there and pick us up because we only have one car. We need another car, but I need a job. I can\u2019t get a job without daycare, so I need to work at the daycare for a discount and immediate enrollment. He does think it\u2019s too far and will result in longer days and less time with family. \n\nI have asked him a thousand times to take things off my plate, but like the lady from TikTok says \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a list\u201d. It\u2019s simple home care, and child care. I should not have to tell him ways to keep his house functioning. BUT, this is his first year with a normal 9-5-esque job, and it\u2019s as a teacher. And I want to be patient with him. \n\nSo we need to do a major overhaul, I understand. I don\u2019t feel like I know where to begin. \n\nIs the consensus just that he needs to change careers? His degrees are in philosophy, anthropology, and secondary education. \n\nAt this point we just need to be the poster for what not to do lol, because anthropology is no better. ",

It\u2019s simple home care, and child care. I should not have to tell him ways to keep his house functioning. BUT, this is his first year with a normal 9-5-esque job, and it\u2019s as a teacher. And I want to be patient with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we need to do a major overhaul, I understand. I don\u2019t feel like I know where to begin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the consensus just that he needs to change careers? His degrees are in philosophy, anthropology, and secondary education. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point we just need to be the poster for what not to do lol, because anthropology is no better. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

How to resign?\"*\n\nI'm fabricating these post titles, but any subscriber to this sub for the past month recognizes a trend among first-year teacher postings. Some first-year teachers are treading water right now - surviving, if not thriving. Many more are stressed, panicked, scared. *Teacher training felt so much different!* many seem to think. *I didn't know it would be like this. How soon can I resign?* \n\nI've got some news for you, first years, as a \"seasoned\" veteran (on year 5, so take that with a grain of salt): \n\nThis. Is. Totally. Normal.  In fact, what you're going through has been [documented by professionals:] (http://www.newteachercenter.org/blog/phases-first-year-teaching) If you follow the \"normal\" progression of first-year teaching, you're going to slump until Christmas, and have some dark nights of the soul. *But just knowing that's going to happen - knowing that it's normal - can help you!*\n\nTeaching is a profession with a steep learning curve like no other. You're experiencing something called 'decision fatigue': even if you are making the RIGHT instructional choices, you are literally making **thousands of micro-decisions a day that you have never been asked to make before**. Can Johnny go to the bathroom? How about Shirley, who you know is bored and doesn't really have to pee? How will you differentiate for the 12 kids with IEPs in your class of 35+? What will you do when the kids defy your seating chart? Figure out you're a first-year? When the principal walks in? When someone sets something on fire? \n\nThese are all decisions that you are capable of handling. But the point is, you haven't had to negotiate them yet. So you're stressed.  And as any veteran here can tell you: \n\n*It will get better*. \n\nSome advice: \n\n* **Don't re-invent the wheel.** You may have been told this nominates you for Worst Teacher of the Year, but it's OK to assign questions from the textbook sometimes. Whatever you think of TeachersPayTeachers, pay $5 for a worksheet or two when it's 2AM and you're spinning your wheels. The world will not end. The content you are teaching is NOT new.  Other people have systems about how to teach it. Before you make up your own system, focus on delivering it smoothly first. \n* **Relationships first.** Your behavior plans may change throughout the year as you find a system that works for you. But kids aren't going to follow you unless they like you on some level. Chat with kids in the hallway, go to their football games, whatever. But before content, you have to get them on your side. \n* **Schedule ONE night - at least one a week - that is just for YOU.** Take a pottery class, Crossfit, go to the bar, whatever. Make this day sacred. You will be a better, more human person and teacher for it. \n* **There is always more to do. ALWAYS. Prioritize.** Before you leave the building that day, ask yourself, \"What are the 3-5 most important things I need to do?\" Do those. The rest can get done tomorrow. \n* **Use your resources.** Your mentor teacher? Hit them up. It's literally their job to get you better. Your mentor sucks? That's why we're here. Go to a conference this year and vow to try something you see. Teaching is a community profession. We're a village. What you've gone through, 100 other teachers have faced too. You won't make it if you're an island. \n\nI remember where you guys were, and I almost quit. My first year teaching, I thought I was going to die. I puked/had diarrhea every morning. I thought the kids hated me. I thought I wasn't cut out for this, and Googled \"How to quit teaching\" every night. I actually fell into a literal depression, and needed to medicate with Zoloft + therapy (which was life-saving. Take care of yourself!!!!)\n\nAnd then... sometime after Christmas.... it just started to get better. I started to figure shit out. The decisions weren't so new anymore. I started to really focus on the kids. Things just started to *click.* \n\nThis will happen to you, too, if you work at it and believe in this process and understand that this is normal.\n\nTrust. \n \nYou can do this!\n",

It&amp;#39;s day two and I want to quit!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Is it normal to puke every day before class?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not cut out for this. How to resign?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fabricating these post titles, but any subscriber to this sub for the past month recognizes a trend among first-year teacher postings. Some first-year teachers are treading water right now - surviving, if not thriving. Many more are stressed, panicked, scared. &lt;em&gt;Teacher training felt so much different!&lt;/em&gt; many seem to think. &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know it would be like this. How soon can I resign?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some news for you, first years, as a &amp;quot;seasoned&amp;quot; veteran (on year 5, so take that with a grain of salt): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This. Is. Totally. Normal.  In fact, what you&amp;#39;re going through has been &lt;a href=\"http://www.newteachercenter.org/blog/phases-first-year-teaching\"&gt;documented by professionals:&lt;/a&gt; If you follow the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; progression of first-year teaching, you&amp;#39;re going to slump until Christmas, and have some dark nights of the soul. &lt;em&gt;But just knowing that&amp;#39;s going to happen - knowing that it&amp;#39;s normal - can help you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teaching is a profession with a steep learning curve like no other. You&amp;#39;re experiencing something called &amp;#39;decision fatigue&amp;#39;: even if you are making the RIGHT instructional choices, you are literally making &lt;strong&gt;thousands of micro-decisions a day that you have never been asked to make before&lt;/strong&gt;. Can Johnny go to the bathroom? How about Shirley, who you know is bored and doesn&amp;#39;t really have to pee? How will you differentiate for the 12 kids with IEPs in your class of 35+? What will you do when the kids defy your seating chart? Figure out you&amp;#39;re a first-year? When the principal walks in? When someone sets something on fire? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all decisions that you are capable of handling. But the point is, you haven&amp;#39;t had to negotiate them yet. So you&amp;#39;re stressed.  And as any veteran here can tell you: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It will get better&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some advice: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t re-invent the wheel.&lt;/strong&gt; You may have been told this nominates you for Worst Teacher of the Year, but it&amp;#39;s OK to assign questions from the textbook sometimes. Whatever you think of TeachersPayTeachers, pay $5 for a worksheet or two when it&amp;#39;s 2AM and you&amp;#39;re spinning your wheels. The world will not end. The content you are teaching is NOT new.  Other people have systems about how to teach it. Before you make up your own system, focus on delivering it smoothly first. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships first.&lt;/strong&gt; Your behavior plans may change throughout the year as you find a system that works for you. But kids aren&amp;#39;t going to follow you unless they like you on some level. Chat with kids in the hallway, go to their football games, whatever. But before content, you have to get them on your side. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule ONE night - at least one a week - that is just for YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a pottery class, Crossfit, go to the bar, whatever. Make this day sacred. You will be a better, more human person and teacher for it. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is always more to do. ALWAYS. Prioritize.&lt;/strong&gt; Before you leave the building that day, ask yourself, &amp;quot;What are the 3-5 most important things I need to do?&amp;quot; Do those. The rest can get done tomorrow. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your resources.&lt;/strong&gt; Your mentor teacher? Hit them up. It&amp;#39;s literally their job to get you better. Your mentor sucks? That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here. Go to a conference this year and vow to try something you see. Teaching is a community profession. We&amp;#39;re a village. What you&amp;#39;ve gone through, 100 other teachers have faced too. You won&amp;#39;t make it if you&amp;#39;re an island. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember where you guys were, and I almost quit. My first year teaching, I thought I was going to die. I puked/had diarrhea every morning. I thought the kids hated me. I thought I wasn&amp;#39;t cut out for this, and Googled &amp;quot;How to quit teaching&amp;quot; every night. I actually fell into a literal depression, and needed to medicate with Zoloft + therapy (which was life-saving. Take care of yourself!!!!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then... sometime after Christmas.... it just started to get better. I started to figure shit out. The decisions weren&amp;#39;t so new anymore. I started to really focus on the kids. Things just started to &lt;em&gt;click.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will happen to you, too, if you work at it and believe in this process and understand that this is normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do this!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I know you all make a million decisions a day, &amp; you all enlightened me on decision fatigue, so is it normal for you to also forget things in your personal life?\n\nI mean, your brains are probably overloaded, so I think it makes sense. Anyways, sometimes I'll have to tell my boyfriend (the 3rd grade teacher) things multiple times over the course of a week/month. Sometimes he'll forget conversations, dates (like specific occasions, not date night) &amp; then I'll have to remind him. Sometimes it's little stuff, sometimes it's major stuff. I don't get mad or upset, because I don't get the feeling that this is coming from a place of him not caring or paying attention, just brain overload. \n\nHe is very detail-oriented &amp; meticulous, which is why I *don't* make a big deal out of it, just gently remind him of whatever he hasn't remembered. Typically with prompting, he remembers whatever I'm talking about. Rarely is he ever clueless when I remind him of something. I know he probably feels bad for forgetting &amp; I don't want to make him feel worse.\n\nSo, teachers, what is your experience?",

Sometimes it&amp;#39;s little stuff, sometimes it&amp;#39;s major stuff. I don&amp;#39;t get mad or upset, because I don&amp;#39;t get the feeling that this is coming from a place of him not caring or paying attention, just brain overload. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is very detail-oriented &amp;amp; meticulous, which is why I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; make a big deal out of it, just gently remind him of whatever he hasn&amp;#39;t remembered. Typically with prompting, he remembers whatever I&amp;#39;m talking about. Rarely is he ever clueless when I remind him of something. I know he probably feels bad for forgetting &amp;amp; I don&amp;#39;t want to make him feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, teachers, what is your experience?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They don\u2019t have tests for two of the four days, but need to stay with me for 4 hours. Since Tuesday a few of the boys have become obsessed with finding where I live, and ended up saying my real address out loud. I denied it, and thankfully they believed me, but they are still obsessed. The reason I\u2019m worried is that I live walking distance from the school.\n\nThey find it funny, but I\u2019ve just tried to shut it down by saying it\u2019s inappropriate or threatening to take their computers if they are not on task. I\u2019ve even tried to explain how it makes me feel uncomfortable, but that only seems to add fuel to the fire. I\u2019ve already shut down most of my social media platforms because of an incident while student teaching where a kid was obsessed with finding my instagram. \n\nShould I contact home and let them know what their kids are up to? Should I contact admin? Again, this might be an obvious answer, but I\u2019m having second thoughts on every decision lately. I think it\u2019s harmless, the main kid in question is a class clown, but I\u2019m concerned it will escalate.",

They don\u2019t have tests for two of the four days, but need to stay with me for 4 hours. Since Tuesday a few of the boys have become obsessed with finding where I live, and ended up saying my real address out loud. I denied it, and thankfully they believed me, but they are still obsessed. The reason I\u2019m worried is that I live walking distance from the school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They find it funny, but I\u2019ve just tried to shut it down by saying it\u2019s inappropriate or threatening to take their computers if they are not on task. I\u2019ve even tried to explain how it makes me feel uncomfortable, but that only seems to add fuel to the fire. I\u2019ve already shut down most of my social media platforms because of an incident while student teaching where a kid was obsessed with finding my instagram. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I contact home and let them know what their kids are up to? Should I contact admin? Again, this might be an obvious answer, but I\u2019m having second thoughts on every decision lately. I think it\u2019s harmless, the main kid in question is a class clown, but I\u2019m concerned it will escalate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He shows that professionals (specifically umpires) make worse decisions (calling balls and strikes) after being asked to do so repetitively. This is called decision fatigue, and a lot of us know about it, and experience it.  I'm sure that most of you know that school teachers make about as many decisions per work time as a trauma surgeon during a mass trauma event. However, what was interesting is that umpires were able to increase the quality of decisions *up to a point* when it is more important moments, however, they **cannot** hold that decision making ability up.\n\nWhere this becomes new and interesting, is that baseball games have a nice break where umpires don't need to make a decision for about 2-3 minutes, which is during a pitching change, or during a inning break.  The moment these umpires get these breaks, they immediately return to their normal skills at decision making\n\nWhat does this mean for teaching: It is important to recognize when you have made multiple high-stress or important decisions in a short period of time, and do *something* that allow you to not make decisions for 2-3 minutes.\n\nNow, you might think: \"I don't have TIME to do that.\"  Well, here's the deal:  Your ability to make good decisions drops off significantly, to the point that it affects your job enough that a decision might actually cost you your job.\n\nOn top of that, the decision to take a break is itself a decision.  So take this out of your hands as much as you can.  Set in \"decision-less periods\" in your day, so that you don't have to decide on things to reset.\n\n The second paper is by Hengchen Dai about \"Fresh Start Moments\" that shows that players who are doing poorly switch leagues during a trade perform better than players who do not switch leagues.\n\nThis might take a little explanation, since some of you might not know that because of the historical way that baseball used to work (two separate leagues that only met in the World Series and the All Star Game), the measurements of a baseball player are measured separately when they change leagues.\n\nSo, basically, what you did up to the point of a season you do in one league doesn't matter when you get traded to the other league.  It really, really doesn't matter in reality, but it very much does matter *in the mind of the player*.\n\nThink about what this means for yourself, for your students, and for your admin.  Just by RESETTING your low statistics (or performance measures) you improve your results.  Now, the opposite is also true:  If you have good statistics, you get worse results by resetting them.\n\nJust some thoughts I had as I learned about these two studies.\n\nAlso: Go Mariners!",

I'm coming from a student teaching placement in an urban public school with a highly controlled curriculum.  I'm also used to getting every lesson plan &amp; decision approved by my cooperating teacher who watched me all day every day.  I'm now in an environment where I have complete control over all decisions, and very little curriculum structure.  I remember reading the word \"decision fatigue\" that happens to new teachers, and it's happening to me!   Perhaps one saving grace is my familiarity with many of the faculty, the building, the school culture and rules that is easing the abrupt transition. \n\nI'm conflicted because I am taking over for a teacher mid-year (who was well liked by his students).  I feel a slight obligation to maintain some of his classroom protocols just to help the students with an easier transition.   However, this teacher was asked to leave lesson plans, and just left a list of chapters and sections from a textbook (for them to \"read and take notes\") spanning a month.  So I'm immediately going to need to write some plans if I expect my students to actually learn this material.  \n\nIt's a lot, and although it's not surprising or unexpected, I'm just looking for feedback, tips, advice, about how to make this easier on myself and my students. \n\nThanks!   \n\n(**TL;DR** - New teacher, mid-year transition, HELP!)",

So I&amp;#39;m immediately going to need to write some plans if I expect my students to actually learn this material.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot, and although it&amp;#39;s not surprising or unexpected, I&amp;#39;m just looking for feedback, tips, advice, about how to make this easier on myself and my students. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - New teacher, mid-year transition, HELP!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've done this type of subbing before - last year I covered 7 months at the school I student taught at.\n\nAnyways, I figured today I'd go in, go over stuff with the teacher, and things would be pretty seamless and easy.  I absolutely did not take into account (and it seems silly, but it happened) what being in a brand new school with brand new ways of doing things would do to my state of mind.  I won't have too much intense planning to do, the grading practices are quick and simple, all the kids are great, and the other teachers in the department are all incredibly friendly and willing to lend a hand.  That said, everything is done on paper - I'm not trying to be a jerk, but the technology at the school doesn't seem to have progressed at all for at least ten years.  I came from an environment with 1:1 computing where all the teaching resources were saved on drives for different departments on an on-site server...just little things like that.\n\nI already have an idea of how I will be organizing things for myself, but today I caught myself at my old habit of \"staring at the floor\".  Doesn't have to actually be a floor, it could be any number of things.  What happens is while I'm sitting there thinking \"OK what do I do next?\" I end up literally zoning out and not doing anything at all for around an hour.  I don't know if it's decision fatigue (seems to be the new explanation being offered for this sort of thing) or just plain being overwhelmed at a new transition, but I'm not a real big fan.  I've got stuff to get done, and there will be plenty of time to stare at floors when this subbing gig is over.\n\nJust curious if anybody else has experienced this, and if so, how do you get over it?\n\nThanks!",
