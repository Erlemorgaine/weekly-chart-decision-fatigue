                    "selftext": "YouTube is the largest video-sharing platform on the internet and is also among the biggest search engines. And just like any other search engine, we need YouTube SEO to optimize our videos and channels to improve their visibility on the platform.\n\nAnd this is becoming increasingly vital due to the high competition and growing content volume. So here are some tips for YouTube to favor your channel and your videos in users' search results:\n\n**1. Research the Keywords**\n\nResearch for keywords is an essential part of both YouTube SEO as well as for Google. By using appropriate keywords the platform will be able to determine the subject of the videos, index the content and associate it with users' searches.\n\nYou must add the keywords in certain fields like tags, titles, and description areas.\n\n**2. Video Title**\n\nAfter doing great research on keywords, you should make sure you are putting them in the title area. This is one of the most important factors for YouTube to index and rank the content.\n\nAnd, for the video to appear in a good position, the title must be as close as possible to the user\u2019s search terms.\n\n**3. Add Tags**\n\nTags are essential for ranking videos on YouTube. They are among the factors that YouTube considers to identify the subjects of a video and index it correctly, but also to recommend related videos.\n\nAnd those suggestions are also an important source of traffic for your videos.\n\n**4. Write Smart Descriptions**\n\nA description is another important field that needs to be filled smartly while uploading videos on YouTube. This text should provide information about what the video is about in the most descriptive way possible.\n\nIf the title needs to be concise, the description can be longer and more detailed. You have up to 5000 characters for this.\n\nThe description is essential for ranking for two reasons. It can be an instrument of persuasion for the user to access the video since its initial portion appears in the search results\u2014so try to keep the main information at the beginning of the text.\n\nWith an attractive description, you can increase your video engagement and earn points with YouTube.\n\n**5. Edit File Name**\n\nDid you know that YouTube SEO techniques begin even before you upload your video? This is because you already need to include the content\u2019s main keyword in the file name.\n\nInstead of uploading the video with a name full of codes and numbers (e.g. VID\\_94800805.mp4), which is incomprehensible to YouTube, use a descriptive name with the keyword (e.g., how-to-do-youtube-seo.mp4).\n\n**6. Transcription And Captions**\n\nYouTube\u2019s algorithm is not able to read images and videos\u2014only text and code. Therefore, one of the strategies you can adopt so that it understands what your content is about is to create transcriptions and captions.\n\n**7. Increase CTR in search results**\n\nCTR (Click-Through Rate) represents the rate with which users click on your video among the available search results.\n\nTo YouTube, having a high click-through rate means that your video was relevant to that keyword that the user searched for. For this reason, CTR is also an important ranking factor.\n\n**8. Create Custom Thumbnails**\n\nHave you ever chosen something to watch on YouTube (or any other streaming video platform) based solely on the appeal of the preview image?\n\nIf so, then you\u2019re already familiar with how important the right thumbnail can be.\n\nYour thumbnail is quite literally the first thing a user sees when they stumble across your video listing, and it can make or break someone\u2019s decision to click on it or not.\n\nGreat thumbnails can drastically increase your traffic and watch times, leading to higher search rankings not only on YouTube but also across search engines. So choose your thumbnails with care.\n\n**9. End screens and YouTube cards**\n\nIf you want your audience to do something specific as a result of watching your video, it\u2019s important not to leave anything up to chance.\n\nTell them directly via a clear call-to-action (CTA). It not only ensures your viewers will complete the correct action instead of missing the shot, but it also helps ease decision fatigue.\n\nOf course, you can (and should) integrate verbal CTAs into your content, but you should also use the built-in features YouTube includes, like YouTube cards and end screens.\n\n**10. Keep a close eye on your analytics**\n\nThe only real way to gauge the success of a YouTube SEO strategy is to monitor your analytics closely. It\u2019s the best way to figure out what\u2019s working for your videos and where you could stand to improve.\n\n**The easy way there!**\n\nI know all this seems like a lot to do and this is the reason why I recommend reputed YouTube SEO tools to get the best SEO results without spending a fortune. This is because the correct tool finds the perfect keywords, tags, titles, and descriptions for your videos while analyzing the latest trends and competitor strategies.\n\nThis helps you optimize your theme and videos easily to appear at the top of YouTube search results and in the suggestions of popular videos. I'm currently using Tuberank Jeet for its affordability and complete features.\n\nBut you must make sure to check all the popular options as well in view of your exact needs and budget before deciding on the right tool.

And just like any other search engine, we need YouTube SEO to optimize our videos and channels to improve their visibility on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is becoming increasingly vital due to the high competition and growing content volume. So here are some tips for YouTube to favor your channel and your videos in users&amp;#39; search results:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Research the Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Research for keywords is an essential part of both YouTube SEO as well as for Google. By using appropriate keywords the platform will be able to determine the subject of the videos, index the content and associate it with users&amp;#39; searches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must add the keywords in certain fields like tags, titles, and description areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Video Title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After doing great research on keywords, you should make sure you are putting them in the title area. This is one of the most important factors for YouTube to index and rank the content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, for the video to appear in a good position, the title must be as close as possible to the user\u2019s search terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Add Tags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tags are essential for ranking videos on YouTube. They are among the factors that YouTube considers to identify the subjects of a video and index it correctly, but also to recommend related videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those suggestions are also an important source of traffic for your videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Write Smart Descriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A description is another important field that needs to be filled smartly while uploading videos on YouTube. This text should provide information about what the video is about in the most descriptive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the title needs to be concise, the description can be longer and more detailed. You have up to 5000 characters for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The description is essential for ranking for two reasons. It can be an instrument of persuasion for the user to access the video since its initial portion appears in the search results\u2014so try to keep the main information at the beginning of the text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an attractive description, you can increase your video engagement and earn points with YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Edit File Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you know that YouTube SEO techniques begin even before you upload your video? This is because you already need to include the content\u2019s main keyword in the file name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of uploading the video with a name full of codes and numbers (e.g. VID_94800805.mp4), which is incomprehensible to YouTube, use a descriptive name with the keyword (e.g., how-to-do-youtube-seo.mp4).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Transcription And Captions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube\u2019s algorithm is not able to read images and videos\u2014only text and code. Therefore, one of the strategies you can adopt so that it understands what your content is about is to create transcriptions and captions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Increase CTR in search results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CTR (Click-Through Rate) represents the rate with which users click on your video among the available search results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To YouTube, having a high click-through rate means that your video was relevant to that keyword that the user searched for. For this reason, CTR is also an important ranking factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Create Custom Thumbnails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever chosen something to watch on YouTube (or any other streaming video platform) based solely on the appeal of the preview image?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so, then you\u2019re already familiar with how important the right thumbnail can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your thumbnail is quite literally the first thing a user sees when they stumble across your video listing, and it can make or break someone\u2019s decision to click on it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great thumbnails can drastically increase your traffic and watch times, leading to higher search rankings not only on YouTube but also across search engines. So choose your thumbnails with care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. End screens and YouTube cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want your audience to do something specific as a result of watching your video, it\u2019s important not to leave anything up to chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell them directly via a clear call-to-action (CTA). It not only ensures your viewers will complete the correct action instead of missing the shot, but it also helps ease decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can (and should) integrate verbal CTAs into your content, but you should also use the built-in features YouTube includes, like YouTube cards and end screens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Keep a close eye on your analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only real way to gauge the success of a YouTube SEO strategy is to monitor your analytics closely. It\u2019s the best way to figure out what\u2019s working for your videos and where you could stand to improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The easy way there!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know all this seems like a lot to do and this is the reason why I recommend reputed YouTube SEO tools to get the best SEO results without spending a fortune. This is because the correct tool finds the perfect keywords, tags, titles, and descriptions for your videos while analyzing the latest trends and competitor strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This helps you optimize your theme and videos easily to appear at the top of YouTube search results and in the suggestions of popular videos. I&amp;#39;m currently using Tuberank Jeet for its affordability and complete features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you must make sure to check all the popular options as well in view of your exact needs and budget before deciding on the right tool.

By using appropriate keywords the platform will be able to determine the subject of the videos, index the content and associate it with users&amp;#39; searches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must add the keywords in certain fields like tags, titles, and description areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Video Title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After doing great research on keywords, you should make sure you are putting them in the title area. This is one of the most important factors for YouTube to index and rank the content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, for the video to appear in a good position, the title must be as close as possible to the user\u2019s search terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Add Tags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tags are essential for ranking videos on YouTube. They are among the factors that YouTube considers to identify the subjects of a video and index it correctly, but also to recommend related videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those suggestions are also an important source of traffic for your videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Write Smart Descriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A description is another important field that needs to be filled smartly while uploading videos on YouTube. This text should provide information about what the video is about in the most descriptive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the title needs to be concise, the description can be longer and more detailed. You have up to 5000 characters for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The description is essential for ranking for two reasons. It can be an instrument of persuasion for the user to access the video since its initial portion appears in the search results\u2014so try to keep the main information at the beginning of the text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an attractive description, you can increase your video engagement and earn points with YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Edit File Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you know that YouTube SEO techniques begin even before you upload your video? This is because you already need to include the content\u2019s main keyword in the file name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of uploading the video with a name full of codes and numbers (e.g. VID_94800805.mp4), which is incomprehensible to YouTube, use a descriptive name with the keyword (e.g., how-to-do-youtube-seo.mp4).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Transcription And Captions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YouTube\u2019s algorithm is not able to read images and videos\u2014only text and code. Therefore, one of the strategies you can adopt so that it understands what your content is about is to create transcriptions and captions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Increase CTR in search results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CTR (Click-Through Rate) represents the rate with which users click on your video among the available search results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To YouTube, having a high click-through rate means that your video was relevant to that keyword that the user searched for. For this reason, CTR is also an important ranking factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Create Custom Thumbnails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever chosen something to watch on YouTube (or any other streaming video platform) based solely on the appeal of the preview image?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so, then you\u2019re already familiar with how important the right thumbnail can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your thumbnail is quite literally the first thing a user sees when they stumble across your video listing, and it can make or break someone\u2019s decision to click on it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great thumbnails can drastically increase your traffic and watch times, leading to higher search rankings not only on YouTube but also across search engines. So choose your thumbnails with care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. End screens and YouTube cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want your audience to do something specific as a result of watching your video, it\u2019s important not to leave anything up to chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell them directly via a clear call-to-action (CTA). It not only ensures your viewers will complete the correct action instead of missing the shot, but it also helps ease decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can (and should) integrate verbal CTAs into your content, but you should also use the built-in features YouTube includes, like YouTube cards and end screens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Keep a close eye on your analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only real way to gauge the success of a YouTube SEO strategy is to monitor your analytics closely. It\u2019s the best way to figure out what\u2019s working for your videos and where you could stand to improve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The easy way there!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know all this seems like a lot to do and this is the reason why I recommend reputed YouTube SEO tools to get the best SEO results without spending a fortune. This is because the correct tool finds the perfect keywords, tags, titles, and descriptions for your videos while analyzing the latest trends and competitor strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This helps you optimize your theme and videos easily to appear at the top of YouTube search results and in the suggestions of popular videos. I&amp;#39;m currently using Tuberank Jeet for its affordability and complete features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you must make sure to check all the popular options as well in view of your exact needs and budget before deciding on the right tool.
