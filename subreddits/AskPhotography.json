I **only need the  camera for stills** and absolutely don\u2019t care about its video  capabilities.\n\nSo my **budget is $600 (body + lens)**, could go slightly higher only if it\u2019s absolutely worth it.  \nI\u2019ll probably be buying a used camera.  \nI made a list below of the things I need from the camera sorted by priority (1 being the most important):\n\n1. Viewfinder- it\u2019s the reason I want to switch in the first place\n2. Supports shooting RAW - I edit all of my photos\n3. Third party lens support - I now use a cheap Meike prime lens and I  love it, Im still not at the point where I feel the need to invest in  high quality glass, I love what I get from these cheap lenses, so the  lens mount on the camera has to be somewhat mainstream because I\u2019d like  to avoid using adapters\n4. Compact - Just small enough to fit in my sling bag, no specific size, just not dslr sizes\n5. Manual controls (not a must) - I\u2019d like to have a dedicated buttons/ dials for the iso controls\n6. Style (not a must) - I like retro styled cameras\n\nThe WiFi/bluetooth capabilities don\u2019t matter to me, I just take out the card and put it in my computer.  \nYear of release doesn\u2019t matter.  \nSensor size doesn\u2019t matter, could be M43, APSC, as long as it\u2019s within budget.\n\nI've been eyeing several models:\n\nNikon Z FC (out of my budget but has most of what I need)\n\nOlympus OM-D EM models (naming is very confusing, I still don't understand which one is which)\n\nFujifilm X-T20/X-T30\n\nPanasonic lumix GX80/GX85\n\nSony a6XXX\n\n\n\nMaybe there are models I don't know about, like when I first started searching for a mirrorless camera, the X-A7 was not a popular model and it was marketed as a vlogging camera but it was a real bang for the buck and I like the images I can make with it.\n\nThank you in advance!",
