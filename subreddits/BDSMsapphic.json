I get to tell her what to do so she doesn't have to make any decisions and she gets to do the things she needs to! \n\nThe thing I'm struggling with is coming up with good ways to reward her for obedience that are not necessarily sexual, or only slightly sexual: though we have a sexual relationship this is not the primary motivator. We live separately but not long distance so things that work digitally as well as irl are encouraged! \n\nI also would love suggestions for ways to keep things interesting and different because just saying things like \"Do XYZ for me because Good Girls do as they're told\" is going to get old quick!!! \n\nThank you in advance!!",
