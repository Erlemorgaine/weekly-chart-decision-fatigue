After my third kiddo (now 4yo) I had a very hard time losing the 60lbs of baby weight, in fact I gained 15 lbs after the initial postpartum loss. In the last year I had gained another 15 lbs, and had begun trying to CICO again but it wasn\u2019t working for me like it had between my other pregnancies. At my annual checkup, bloodwork found I was severely iron deficient and was insulin resistant. That knowledge really helped give me insight into why I was often low energy, had lots of food noise, and carb-craving. I read the Glucose Goddess book, and although a lot of it I think is a little too woo for me, I incorporated some of the ideas, things like having a veggie at every meal (I try to roughly match portion of veggie with portion of carb), increasing protein for satiety, savory breakfast instead of sweet. I\u2019ve mostly eliminated snacks and hunger between meals by increasing protein, and I budget for two glasses of wine after my kids go to bed so I don\u2019t go crazy with deprivation. It took a few months to see any significant or consistent result on the scale, and I credit that to adding an after-dinner session of 20-30 min on the elliptical and lowering my calories just a little further than my first run at TDEE math/exercise levels. I had been eating 1700-1800 calories, losing 5 lbs immediately from fluid weight then a disappointing 1/4 lb./week loss until July. I dropped intake to 1500-1600 calories and added short, low intensity elliptical after dinner at least 4x per week, and suddenly it\u2019s 1-2lbs per week consistently (except the week of my period where install, then a woosh). I\u2019ve also worked with a dietitian to help fine tune some habits, she is insightful in a way that helps me understand my own challenges without telling me what to do. For example, I realized after journaling and talking through my struggles and successes of two weeks, the pattern I needed to change was meal prep. It had to be done or I just got so overwhelmed with choices and decision fatigue I put off eating long periods which was not doing my insulin resistance any favors. I have the same thing for breakfast (fairlife 30g protein drink with fiber powder), meal prep lunches for the week of chicken/veg/starch, and we have a rough outline for dinner themes (kid friendly like Monday Brinner, Taco Tuesday, etc) to guide our choices because my husband makes dinner and also suffers from \u201cstare into the fridge and see nothing that goes together\u201d like I do. Dinner is usually whatever everyone has but portion controlled, like last week on take out night I had a bunless turkey burger with medium McDonald\u2019s fries, on pizza night I have a veg/salad and two slices of pizza, I measure out a cup of pasta on Italian night, etc.",

After my third kiddo (now 4yo) I had a very hard time losing the 60lbs of baby weight, in fact I gained 15 lbs after the initial postpartum loss. In the last year I had gained another 15 lbs, and had begun trying to CICO again but it wasn\u2019t working for me like it had between my other pregnancies. At my annual checkup, bloodwork found I was severely iron deficient and was insulin resistant. That knowledge really helped give me insight into why I was often low energy, had lots of food noise, and carb-craving. I read the Glucose Goddess book, and although a lot of it I think is a little too woo for me, I incorporated some of the ideas, things like having a veggie at every meal (I try to roughly match portion of veggie with portion of carb), increasing protein for satiety, savory breakfast instead of sweet. I\u2019ve mostly eliminated snacks and hunger between meals by increasing protein, and I budget for two glasses of wine after my kids go to bed so I don\u2019t go crazy with deprivation. It took a few months to see any significant or consistent result on the scale, and I credit that to adding an after-dinner session of 20-30 min on the elliptical and lowering my calories just a little further than my first run at TDEE math/exercise levels. I had been eating 1700-1800 calories, losing 5 lbs immediately from fluid weight then a disappointing 1/4 lb./week loss until July. I dropped intake to 1500-1600 calories and added short, low intensity elliptical after dinner at least 4x per week, and suddenly it\u2019s 1-2lbs per week consistently (except the week of my period where install, then a woosh). I\u2019ve also worked with a dietitian to help fine tune some habits, she is insightful in a way that helps me understand my own challenges without telling me what to do. For example, I realized after journaling and talking through my struggles and successes of two weeks, the pattern I needed to change was meal prep. It had to be done or I just got so overwhelmed with choices and decision fatigue I put off eating long periods which was not doing my insulin resistance any favors. I have the same thing for breakfast (fairlife 30g protein drink with fiber powder), meal prep lunches for the week of chicken/veg/starch, and we have a rough outline for dinner themes (kid friendly like Monday Brinner, Taco Tuesday, etc) to guide our choices because my husband makes dinner and also suffers from \u201cstare into the fridge and see nothing that goes together\u201d like I do. Dinner is usually whatever everyone has but portion controlled, like last week on take out night I had a bunless turkey burger with medium McDonald\u2019s fries, on pizza night I have a veg/salad and two slices of pizza, I measure out a cup of pasta on Italian night, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
