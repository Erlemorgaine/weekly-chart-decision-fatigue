I add a vocal, still sounds great - but now I have choices to make: How much of the vocal line do I use before a rest? Do I chop the vocal up, add a reverb effect and make it more \"EDMish\" or do I let it ring out like a more traditional vocal? I try both, BOTH SOUND GOOD!!! Which do I settle on? Ok, I put a synth hit at bar 15, sounds cool... Then I try moving it to bar 18, which also sounds cool. But both places is too overpowering, where do I put it!?!?\n\nBasically, these little creative decisions I will fall into an indecisive loop about, which fatigues my creative brain and makes me end my session early. Its almost like a fear of making the track worse, or F'ing it up when it had so much potential, etc...\n\nSometimes this even leads me to keep \"save as\"ing the track in case I want to go back without having to hit undo 150 times and hope I remember exactly where I was, etc...\n\nAny tips or resources for overcoming this would be greatly appreciated.",

Besides this, I have no musical background. Never learnt an instrument or anything.\n\nI've always struggled so immensely with self doubt, even though ive been fairly successful as a DJ, I still can't help but question my talent and wonder if I just got lucky in that aspect. I picked it up pretty easily I guess.\n\nBut then with music production, it's a whole other thing and I'm really struggling. As soon as I sit down to write a track I have the worst anxiety just knowing it's going to suck. I know that's a horrible perspective to have going into it, but even on the rare days where I feel confident, everything I make just sucks. \n\nWhen I compare myself to friends who have started at the same time as me, I feel even more depressed over how little I've progressed. It's rarely an enjoyable experience for me because I critique myself so harshly I just can't enjoy it. \n\nI also have ADD which strongly impacts my decision making, confusion of not knowing where to start, and overall feeling like a failure. Like I'd say I'm at an intermediate level but still, I don't know what part of my technique I need to work on first, what I should learn about, which tutorials to watch, what equipment to buy. It's fucking draining.\n\nI got into this because I love music more than anything, and ive always wanted to create music to share with the world. But now Im second guessing if it's just not for me and that makes me sad :( \n\nI guess I'm just wanting to know if anyone else has been through something similar and if there's light at the end of the tunnel? Also would appreciate some really good guides to making music that will help with my decision fatigue and advancing my overall  skills. \n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f",
