It has taken a great deal of anxiety, resilience, mental anguish and emotional detachment to get there.\n\nMy days are taken up with a lot of pastoral care for my students and the only way I, personally, have been able to deal with the shit I hear AND the general workload / behaviour management / admin / parent shit that comes with being a teacher is to emotionally detach in a way. I don't detach from my students - I am always empathetic, aware and emotionally responsive. I have had to detach from my OWN feelings about the situation(s) because I could not cope or carry on the way I was for my own longevity. I used to cry in my first few years when kids said horrible/rude things and now I feel... not a lot. I feel a lot of empathy when they tell me the horrible shit they go through, but I deal with it professionally and don't take it home with me like I used to.\n\nAlthough it has helped me in my teaching, it continues to cause arguments and rifts at home with my boyfriend/partner. He gets upset about the fact that I don't want to talk about work (I spend the car ride home dealing with my day - I don't want to be asked about it as soon as I walk through the door), he's told me that I \"lacked empathy\" (towards him, for context), and is upset by the fact that I am in an almost 'zombie' like state when I get home.\n\nHonestly - I feel a mental fog, decision fatigue and a longing desire to just be left alone when I get home, at least for a little while. And he's correct - I don't have a lot of empathy for his issues always because... like, one of my students is homeless or I've recently had to report some abhorrent sexual abuse. My empathy has dried up by the time I get home.\n\n**Am I an absolute asshole and totally alone in this? Is it normal to emotionally detach this much while doing this job? How do you find a balance in your personal life?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Edit: Thank you so much, everybody. I haven't done much responding but I've read everything here. I had a lot of anxiety posting this but all the comments have been so utterly supportive. A colleague of mine told me they were worried about me a few days ago (I was finding it impossible to mask in the last two weeks of school), recommended seeing a psychologist and told me their own story. It is clearly something we all struggle with and I feel less alone/not like a complete failure thanks to that colleague and all of you. The reality is, our education system is so, so, broken and too often relies on our good will and care to continue putting students over our own mental health and wellbeing.***  \n\n\n***I will be spending this break getting on top of my physical and mental health. Thank you for your kind words and encouragement - I'll try and get back to some of the great advice and feedback on this thread as well.*** ",

I've been doing these jobs full time, as well as doing full time uni coursework. By the time I finish my last teaching placement and GTPA this year, it'll be time to apply for jobs for next year. \n\nI can't help but feel decision-fatigued and burnt out already, even though I've not 'technically' started a teaching career yet! I feel like doing something different, or maybe even taking a break just for a term or so. Of course CRT is an option, but just wondering what are some other jobs / experiences people did after their degree before they went and did a full time position?  \nSorry for the vent - just feeling a bit lost.

I&amp;#39;ve been doing these jobs full time, as well as doing full time uni coursework. By the time I finish my last teaching placement and GTPA this year, it&amp;#39;ll be time to apply for jobs for next year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but feel decision-fatigued and burnt out already, even though I&amp;#39;ve not &amp;#39;technically&amp;#39; started a teaching career yet! I feel like doing something different, or maybe even taking a break just for a term or so. Of course CRT is an option, but just wondering what are some other jobs / experiences people did after their degree before they went and did a full time position?&lt;br/&gt;\nSorry for the vent - just feeling a bit lost. Any similar experiences would be helpful!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
