For those of us trying to manage our weight, it can be hard to moderate portions; decision fatigue is real.\n\nThere are, however, strategies for dealing with holiday treats. Ask yourself a few questions before blindly accepting a holiday treat: is it something you really want? Is it something special/something homemade? Is it something you\u2019ve never had, but want to try? Is it something that is seasonal, and can only be eaten now (etc.)? Make a list of these questions (as they apply to you), and run through the checklist in your head before just automatically saying yes. \n\nAnd, if you do say yes to something special, there\u2019s no law that says you have to eat it on the spot, the minute you are offered it. You can save it for whenever it fits into your plan. \n\nAnd, if you celebrate a big Christmas with family, I would encourage you to enjoy your  dinner. A special Christmas dinner is one day. No one ever became 100 pounds overweight from one big day of excess. If you do overeat, or eat more than you had planned on the day itself, you haven\u2019t ruined anything. Like the title says, it\u2019s not the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s that matters. It\u2019s the other 51 weeks of good habits that matter. \n\nThere are lots of great strategies for managing your intake while still enjoying special holiday meals and events. Get active on Christmas Day; make a new family \u201cSanta Shuffle\u201d tradition (where you all wear goofy Christmas hats and go 5km around the neighborhood spreading as much holiday cheer as possible to everyone you see). Plan to make, eat, and enjoy something you wouldn\u2019t normally eat while on a calorie deficit. Crush your siblings at board games. Breakout the corn hole set and challenge every uncle you have to a Christmas championship. In other words, enjoy your holidays!\n\nThese are just a few examples of how to have a more balanced holiday season. There is a middle ground between just eating mindlessly and denying yourself things you would normally enjoy. If you have some strategies to share that have worked for you, share them in the comments! \n\nHappy Holidays r/loseit!",

However I find myself getting decision fatigue and I really would love it if I could find a program or person who can build a routine based off of the equipment I have and help take the decisions away. It would be so easy if I could come home and just know this is what I\u2019m doing today. I workout at night and after a long days work I\u2019m just ready to crank it out and end my day. \n\nAnyone know of any program or person who would do this? I am so new to this world I just have no clue where to look or who to ask.\n\nJust in case here\u2019s what I have:\n\nSpin Bike\nElliptical \nBrand New SoleF80 Treadmill\nAnd a weight rack with a bench bar and plates.\nI also have yoga equipment and love to do this on my lighter days to stretch out my tense muscles. \nI am also currently at the very beginning of a c25k cycle on the treadmill. \n\nMy current intake is between 1600-1700 cal/day. I would like to take 1-2 days off a week, and to change it up on different days. 20-30 mins cardio every day is a plus. Thanks in Advance!!\n\nTLDR: Is there a person or service that would plan my workout routine around the equipment that I have in my home gym?",

However I find myself getting decision fatigue and I really would love it if I could find a program or person who can build a routine based off of the equipment I have and help take the decisions away. It would be so easy if I could come home and just know this is what I\u2019m doing today. I workout at night and after a long days work I\u2019m just ready to crank it out and end my day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone know of any program or person who would do this? I am so new to this world I just have no clue where to look or who to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just in case here\u2019s what I have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spin Bike\nElliptical \nBrand New SoleF80 Treadmill\nAnd a weight rack with a bench bar and plates.\nI also have yoga equipment and love to do this on my lighter days to stretch out my tense muscles. \nI am also currently at the very beginning of a c25k cycle on the treadmill. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current intake is between 1600-1700 cal/day. I would like to take 1-2 days off a week, and to change it up on different days. 20-30 mins cardio every day is a plus. Thanks in Advance!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Is there a person or service that would plan my workout routine around the equipment that I have in my home gym?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've done various things, including keto and CICO, and most recently dabbled in intermittent fasting.  I just wanted to share something that really resonated with me.  \n\nThere's a concept of \"decision fatigue\" which is well described. Basically, the more decisions you make in your day, the more bad/poor decisions you make over time. \n\nI read an article about diets, which I tried to look for but couldn't find again, about how \"no\" is easier than \"maybe\".  For me, keto worked for me when I had strict rules.  Do you want a cookie?  \"No\", because I'm not eating carbs. It's defined. No mental energy is required. I know the rule. \n\nAlternatively, if you have to make a decision every time you are asked \"do you want a cookie\".  You might say, \"no, I shouldn't\" at first, but then you think, \"I've had a hard day\", and maybe the next time you are asked, you say sure. It wears you down.  Decision fatigue. \n\nEliminating these decisions has helped me.  I recently tried intermittent fasting + CICO.  Nothing extreme. 8 hours eating, 16 hours not.  If I'm outside the 8 hour window, should I grab this bite of this food? No, I'm not allowed.  It's outside my eating window.  End of discussion.  It makes it easier for me to not have to put any mental energy into it. \n\nI hope this helps someone.  It's helped me.",

I can stick to my diet really well until around 8pm.\n\nThat's when almost like a full moon transformation, I devour everything in sight. Fridge, pantry, fruit, whatever.\n\nI'm not sure how to stop this. I've considered putting locks on the fridge and having the lock next to my mom's bed so I can't get in. Or maybe just a locked box in the pantry.\n\nWhat are some strategies or tools that you guys have used to battle this? Sheer willpower? Mental exercises? When decision fatigue hits it becomes hard to not eat for me.\n\nThanks for any advice. Appreciate it.",

                    "selftext": "When I started losing weight earlier this year, I knew two things: 1) restriction diets didn't work for me, and 2) I didn't know how to eat intuitively. Here's some things I learned walking the middle path. Please comment with your reactions and some of the mind tricks you use.\n\n- restriction is all about mindset. For example, I could never do keto because giving up cake would feel restrictive. But I have no problem being vegetarian because it's a choice I made with logic behind it. Other people do great on a keto diet because that way of eating feels good to them, but could never go vegetarian because they love meat too much. I also can't do intermittent fasting because of my history of disordered eating, but some people do better eating that way. To me, it feels too restrictive, but to other people, it feels right and works for their lifestyle. (I generally don't eat at night though because I know my body needs that time to rest and reset my hormone levels).\n\nSome ways I \"restrict\" without restricting:\n\n- limiting myself to one dessert a day. It doesn't feel like punishment because I know excess sugar doesn't support my health goals. One dessert a day feels reasonable.\n\n- when going out to dinner, choosing to do fries OR drinks OR dessert. Again, it just feels reasonable and helps support my health goals, while also allowing me to feel like I'm not giving up foods I really love.\n\n- when eating at a friend's or family member's house, limiting myself to one plate of food. I often want a second plate, but I remind myself that my stomach will be full on one plate of food, even if my brain wants more.\n\n- I don't eat within a couple hours of my last meal. I just know that for me, any hunger pangs I feel during that time are fake, because I know when I eat too soon after my last meal I get groggy and then sometimes have an overeat because I feel like eating again to combat the grogginess. But if I wait a few minutes and drink some water, they go away. This used to be worse when I was starting out and now I don't get the pangs so much or at least I don't notice them.\n\nAs far as eating intuitively, I am definitely still learning. I'm counting calories for now but would like to get to a place where I don't. This is what I do to eat \"intuitive lite.\" \n\n- I still count calories but it's more of a guideline. Some days I'm genuinely hungrier and I eat more, no problem. Some days I'm less hungry but I still make myself eat close to my calorie goal (within 200 calories) because I've learned that if I don't, I don't sleep well\n\n- I don't plan which days to eat at maintenance or higher, but I'm often hungrier in the days leading up to my period so it makes sense when it happens\n\n- I plan my food for the day in the morning. I find that I tend to make bad food choices in those tiny but crucial moments, like when someone surprises me with gift food or I'm really hungry. If I've planned my food for the day, then I don't have decision fatigue. I just follow my plan. Or I break my plan but I do it consciously and change the food in my app before I eat. And if I've eaten all the food on my plan and I'm still hungry, I eat more.\n\n- learning to cut food in half and save some for later. Learning to throw away food. \n\n- Learning to eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm not hungry\n\n- in addition to counting calories and planning my food for the day, I also keep a calendar and a journal. If I've met my calorie goal, I mark the day with an A. If I've eaten closer to maintenance, I mark it with a B. If I've eaten up to 500 calories past maintenance, I mark the day with a C. If I've eaten past that or didn't track calories, I scribble out the day (I used to do that in the beginning but it doesn't happen much anymore). On the next page I keep a weekly calendar, where I track if I've eaten a raw veggie (salad), a cooked veggie, and a fruit. I try to eat one of each every day. I also track my workouts. Finally, I journal pretty much every morning. If I've had an overeat, I journal about it. I don't shame myself or restrict the next day to \"make up\" the calories. I just try to understand how it happened so I don't do it again.\n\nFinally, I'll end with an anecdote. I love tacos. I make them about once a week. Actually more like burritos (because I'm from the Midwest and don't make authentic ones, but the kind with big flour tortillas). They are my favorite. I kept trying to just eat one, and put some veggies on my plate to round out my meal. But I love them SO much. Immediately after eating one, I was dying for a second one. I was really struggling. So what I ended up doing was buying the really big flour tortillas and really filling it up. It ends up being less calories than eating two smaller ones. And I STILL always want a second one so so bad. But I've learned that one is all I need to fill my stomach, so I'm finally able to just eat one and be at peace. I also figured out I can skip the cheese and it still tastes just as good. I didn't have to swear off burritos and I can still eat the thing I love.",

I make them about once a week. Actually more like burritos (because I&amp;#39;m from the Midwest and don&amp;#39;t make authentic ones, but the kind with big flour tortillas). They are my favorite. I kept trying to just eat one, and put some veggies on my plate to round out my meal. But I love them SO much. Immediately after eating one, I was dying for a second one. I was really struggling. So what I ended up doing was buying the really big flour tortillas and really filling it up. It ends up being less calories than eating two smaller ones. And I STILL always want a second one so so bad. But I&amp;#39;ve learned that one is all I need to fill my stomach, so I&amp;#39;m finally able to just eat one and be at peace. I also figured out I can skip the cheese and it still tastes just as good. I didn&amp;#39;t have to swear off burritos and I can still eat the thing I love.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I cook 15-20 servings total on the weekends and my husband and I are set for the week (I have lunch provided by my employer so we only need 3 servings per weekday). It saves me so much stress and time in the evenings. \n\nI try to aim for 3-4 different meals each week so we don\u2019t get bored and want to eat out instead. My goal is under 550 calories per serving with at least 30 g of protein. Here is my basic process:\n\nGet the protein going first since it usually cooks the longest. Weigh everything out before you cook so you get accurate macros. I do marinated sous vide chicken breasts, pulled pork, beef roast, or shredded chicken breast in the instant pot. While the meat is cooking, chop your veggies and roast on a sheet pan. Measure your oil exactly and toss the veggies so they don\u2019t stick. I usually do a large batch of zucchini and another tray of peppers and onions. Next, cook your sides. Usually a big pot of rice (weighed before cooking of course), mashed potatoes, or protein pasta. \n\nLast, prep your sauces or toppings (for example sour cream and guacamole in a small parchment baking cup, chopped green onions, shredded cheese). \n\nWhen everything is done and cooled a bit, you can portion it out, starting with carbs on the bottom. \n\nI know by now that 45g of uncooked rice usually weighs 115g once cooked. But at first I\u2019d dump it all in a bowl, weigh it, and figure out the weight per serving. \n\nFor the meat, weigh the cooked recipe and divide by how many servings you originally weighed (usually 4 oz uncooked per serving). For example, 2 lbs chicken breast is 8 servings. Once cooked, it will weigh less. I use grams for this step because it\u2019s easier to divide. Zero out your scale, pull out a serving, then zero again. \n\nFinally top with sauces and condiments. \n\nI find that doing everything on the weekend saves me decision fatigue and means less dishes through the week. \n\nHere are some of our favorites:\n\n-Chicken satay with Peanut Sauce over Rice (with roasted peppers and onions)\n\n-Lemon Feta orzo with Chicken and Spinach\n\n-Protein Pasta with Red Sauce and Meatballs\n\n-Shredded Green Chile Chicken with Sazon Rice, Black Beans, Cheese, and Sour Cream\n\n-Italian Roast Beef over Cheese Grits with Brocolli\n\n-Pulled Pork over Mashed potatoes with Roasted Zucchini",

Actually, it ultimately made me gain lots of weight because I developed disordered eating without realizing it and was bingeing and restricting for a few years which in the end made me net gain tons of weight. I lost weight very successfully with strict calorie tracking its just that I would spiral and become obsessive and sometimes restrict even more, then get decision fatigue and quit and go in the opposite direction where I would gain the weight back and then some. After I became aware this was happening, I thought that because I was aware of it I could cope now and still be very strict with my calorie counting but in the end I was still falling into these restrict and binge cycles. So, I'm at the point now where, even though it works I don't think its sustainable for me right now and I need to do something different instead of basically trying the same thing over and over again and getting the same results. All of this is something I would like to talk to a therapist about but I can't at the moment because I recently moved to a new city and started a new job, which means switching insurance and also needing to try and find a decent therapist (and get that first appointment with them which could take months).",

Actually, it ultimately made me gain lots of weight because I developed disordered eating without realizing it and was bingeing and restricting for a few years which in the end made me net gain tons of weight. I lost weight very successfully with strict calorie tracking its just that I would spiral and become obsessive and sometimes restrict even more, then get decision fatigue and quit and go in the opposite direction where I would gain the weight back and then some. After I became aware this was happening, I thought that because I was aware of it I could cope now and still be very strict with my calorie counting but in the end I was still falling into these restrict and binge cycles. So, I&amp;#39;m at the point now where, even though it works I don&amp;#39;t think its sustainable for me right now and I need to do something different instead of basically trying the same thing over and over again and getting the same results. All of this is something I would like to talk to a therapist about but I can&amp;#39;t at the moment because I recently moved to a new city and started a new job, which means switching insurance and also needing to try and find a decent therapist (and get that first appointment with them which could take months).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It's our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. \n\nThis identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d \n\nA study published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.\n\nThere were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase **\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d** both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. \n\nAs the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). \n\nThe researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. \n\n39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. \n\nThe idea is then that **one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.**\n\nWe can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. \n\n#Decision fatigue\n\nWe like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.\n\nVeganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).\n\nSome people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. \n\n**Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.**\n\nIn studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).\n\nThere\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. \n\nThis means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates\n\n#Don\u2019t count days. \n\nAnother idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. \n\n**NEVER count days.** Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a \"smoker who went 40 days without it\" or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d\n\n**Every habit is triggered by some event.** For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. \n\nI found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. \n\nThen I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. \n\nThis helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.\n\nThe point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. \n\nTaken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9\n\n#[Watch This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;t)\n\n**Sources:**\n\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions\n\n(1) http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full",

                    "selftext": "I finally reached my goal weight a few weeks ago, and wanted to share. This subreddit was so helpful for me, and I'm hoping to pay that forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo first, the stats:\n\nF/24/5'6\"/139\n\nSW: 172  GW:  140 UGW (maybe?): 130\n\nStarted August 1st, hit goal weight April 9th\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping the backstory short: I was always slightly bigger than the average girl for my age starting in high school. I was an athlete, and didn't really become overweight until college. I didn't think about it a lot and honestly I didn't really care. I was always fine with how I looked. Though I did try to lose weight here and there throughout college, I never seemed to get anywhere. But in the first couple of years after school, I wondered what it would be like to be thin. I always told myself if I hit 170 I would actually try to lose weight. So when I stepped on the scale at my parent's house and saw 172, I decided to finally do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you're interested, here's how I did it (bolded is the tl;dr):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. The title of my post--you have to figure out what you're going to do differently.**\n\nI had to ask myself what my habits and pitfalls were, and how to change them. I had to relearn how to eat and fundamentally change what food was to me. This will vary based on who you are, but if you're like me the following points are all about how I had to restructure my life differently to lose weight and work with, not against, my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. USE NUMBERS**\n\nWhen I had tried to lose weight before, my biggest pitfall was that I thought I wasn't making any progress and then would stop. So this time, I bought a scale, downloaded Happy Scale, and weighed myself every morning. This was the thing that got me excited at the beginning (I lost 9lbs in the first month) and kept me accountable throughout the whole process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also was tracking calories, but I had to travel a lot for work and estimating was really hard. Also, boring. I would often forget to do so, or count inaccurately. I really only tracked consistently for the first couple of months to get a sense of how much food was the right amount of food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Repeating meals is the best tool**\n\nI made the same food over and over again. It had to be tasty, low-calorie, filling, and not take too long to make or require too much cleanup. These meals can be hard to find, but are invaluable. For me, it was a lot of roasted tofu and vegetables with just olive oil, salt, and pepper. But once you have them, you can rely on them as staples. This also helps eliminate decision fatigue. I used to get caught up with making the perfect choice of what to eat that I would end up not even making a good choice. Having delicious, filling, low-calorie, easy fall-back meals got rid of that problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. You can out-run an okay diet**\n\nI exercise a lot. I run 3-6 miles and average about 15000 steps every day. I enjoy it, it's been great for my mental health, and it's been a sustainable life change. As a result, I burn around 2500 calories a day on average even at 140lbs. I really like delicious food, so I am incredibly active in order to allow me to eat as much as I want. This is pretty unusual, and **for the most part I would follow the advice on others here who say you can't outrun a bad diet**. But, running makes me feel fuller, not hungrier. And I find that even if I am not active for a day or a couple of days, I want to eat just as much food as when I am. Everyone is different, and this is just what worked for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Connect your actions to your motivation for performing them**\n\nI'm really bad at forming good habits. I'm impatient and struggle with long-term goals. But something that really helped was whenever I was eating something not as delicious as Five Guys (my achilles heel), and I was like \"why am I doing this,\" I thought \"well, why am I doing this?\" I had a certain set of reasons why I was losing and had to remind myself of those when things were hard. Connecting my actions to my goals made things I didn't want to do feel like things I DID want to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Plan, but don't freak out when things don't go as planned**\n\nKind of related to 2, but make sure to structure things differently. I won't go certain places because I know I'll end up certain unhealthy meals there. I'll go grocery shopping for the aforementioned repeat meals so that I won't eat out as much. These are things that will vary from person to person, but figure out what your pitfalls are an try to plan around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUT don't freak out if you falter, or binge, or if things don't go as planned. Forgive yourself, and move on. Tomorrow is a new day and it doesn't do you any good to beat yourself up or tell yourself that failure is inevitable (things I would often tell myself). Learn from whatever it was that made you falter, and be more prepared for the next time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry that was longer than expected, but thank you again to everyone who has posted on here the past nine months! Your stories have kept me going. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

This subreddit was so helpful for me, and I&amp;#39;m hoping to pay that forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first, the stats:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F/24/5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;/139&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SW: 172  GW:  140 UGW (maybe?): 130&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started August 1st, hit goal weight April 9th&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping the backstory short: I was always slightly bigger than the average girl for my age starting in high school. I was an athlete, and didn&amp;#39;t really become overweight until college. I didn&amp;#39;t think about it a lot and honestly I didn&amp;#39;t really care. I was always fine with how I looked. Though I did try to lose weight here and there throughout college, I never seemed to get anywhere. But in the first couple of years after school, I wondered what it would be like to be thin. I always told myself if I hit 170 I would actually try to lose weight. So when I stepped on the scale at my parent&amp;#39;s house and saw 172, I decided to finally do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;#39;re interested, here&amp;#39;s how I did it (bolded is the tl;dr):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The title of my post--you have to figure out what you&amp;#39;re going to do differently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to ask myself what my habits and pitfalls were, and how to change them. I had to relearn how to eat and fundamentally change what food was to me. This will vary based on who you are, but if you&amp;#39;re like me the following points are all about how I had to restructure my life differently to lose weight and work with, not against, my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. USE NUMBERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I had tried to lose weight before, my biggest pitfall was that I thought I wasn&amp;#39;t making any progress and then would stop. So this time, I bought a scale, downloaded Happy Scale, and weighed myself every morning. This was the thing that got me excited at the beginning (I lost 9lbs in the first month) and kept me accountable throughout the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also was tracking calories, but I had to travel a lot for work and estimating was really hard. Also, boring. I would often forget to do so, or count inaccurately. I really only tracked consistently for the first couple of months to get a sense of how much food was the right amount of food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Repeating meals is the best tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made the same food over and over again. It had to be tasty, low-calorie, filling, and not take too long to make or require too much cleanup. These meals can be hard to find, but are invaluable. For me, it was a lot of roasted tofu and vegetables with just olive oil, salt, and pepper. But once you have them, you can rely on them as staples. This also helps eliminate decision fatigue. I used to get caught up with making the perfect choice of what to eat that I would end up not even making a good choice. Having delicious, filling, low-calorie, easy fall-back meals got rid of that problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You can out-run an okay diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I exercise a lot. I run 3-6 miles and average about 15000 steps every day. I enjoy it, it&amp;#39;s been great for my mental health, and it&amp;#39;s been a sustainable life change. As a result, I burn around 2500 calories a day on average even at 140lbs. I really like delicious food, so I am incredibly active in order to allow me to eat as much as I want. This is pretty unusual, and &lt;strong&gt;for the most part I would follow the advice on others here who say you can&amp;#39;t outrun a bad diet&lt;/strong&gt;. But, running makes me feel fuller, not hungrier. And I find that even if I am not active for a day or a couple of days, I want to eat just as much food as when I am. Everyone is different, and this is just what worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Connect your actions to your motivation for performing them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really bad at forming good habits. I&amp;#39;m impatient and struggle with long-term goals. But something that really helped was whenever I was eating something not as delicious as Five Guys (my achilles heel), and I was like &amp;quot;why am I doing this,&amp;quot; I thought &amp;quot;well, why am I doing this?&amp;quot; I had a certain set of reasons why I was losing and had to remind myself of those when things were hard. Connecting my actions to my goals made things I didn&amp;#39;t want to do feel like things I DID want to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Plan, but don&amp;#39;t freak out when things don&amp;#39;t go as planned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of related to 2, but make sure to structure things differently. I won&amp;#39;t go certain places because I know I&amp;#39;ll end up certain unhealthy meals there. I&amp;#39;ll go grocery shopping for the aforementioned repeat meals so that I won&amp;#39;t eat out as much. These are things that will vary from person to person, but figure out what your pitfalls are an try to plan around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT don&amp;#39;t freak out if you falter, or binge, or if things don&amp;#39;t go as planned. Forgive yourself, and move on. Tomorrow is a new day and it doesn&amp;#39;t do you any good to beat yourself up or tell yourself that failure is inevitable (things I would often tell myself). Learn from whatever it was that made you falter, and be more prepared for the next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry that was longer than expected, but thank you again to everyone who has posted on here the past nine months! Your stories have kept me going. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I continued to track (who wants to break a 125 day streak, right?) even though everything that went in, went right back out. \ud83d\ude05\n\nHalfway though, I decided to weigh myself. 149.8 pounds. The screen lit up. \u201cYOU DID IT!\u201d the app said. \u201cYOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.\u201d \n\nI turned around and went straight back to the bathroom.\n\nOk, but now that it\u2019s been a few days and the sickness is gone, the reality of my new (healthy) body is hitting me. I went to Old Navy and bought sunshine yellow pants in a size 6! Pants were always for dark colors, for hiding, for \u201cflattering.\u201d Never for showing off. I never realized how much of what I thought was \u201cpractical\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d was also hiding. Hiding is boring!\n\nI lost 25 pounds. It\u2019s a huge deal for me but a small thing compared to the accomplishments of many on this page. Some unordered thoughts on the subject:\n\n1. Why I didn\u2019t quit: I read your stories every day. The highlights, the lowlights, the average-looking meals. You gave me a place I felt normal. Where accomplishing my dreams felt accepted and normal. I trusted you to be there, and so I could trust myself to be there with you.\n\n2. On self-image: It\u2019s critical to me that people don\u2019t say, \u201cwow, you look like a different / better person.\u201d I loved, LOVED my body on my wedding day, now 15-20 pounds heavier. No one can take that from me. I treasure the continuity between that girl and myself. She gave me the strength to be here. It\u2019s her goals I am fulfilling now.\n\n3. On food: Satiety is everything. All that stuff about protein, fiber, avoiding sugar spikes? Yeah. That\u2019s the ticket. I found a few favorites that would consistently thwart hunger (oatmeal, Greek yogurt) and ate them a gazillion times. Looking back, I think repetition and limiting choices makes it a lot easier to avoid binging. Binging always stemmed from fatigue\u2014including decision fatigue. Little bites of lots of things at potlucks are much harder to track and stop than moderate portions of 3 foods.\n\n4. On changing taste buds: Tracking with LoseIt intensified my love of cooking, especially with fresh vegetables and tangy / spicy flavor profiles. I encourage you to roast everything, to make your own salad dressings with oil, vinegar, salt, and fresh herbs, and to try new foods you didn\u2019t like before. I still love junk foods, but lots of sour foods I hated before are new favorites. Pickles, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, blueberries\u2014hello, new friends!\n\n5. A moment of honesty: most days felt like I was teetering on the edge. Tiredness and stress would send me back, again and again, to the break room pantry. None of those delicious snack foods are bad or banned, but I knew I was using them as an emotional crutch. I wanted to enjoy food for its own sake. The emotional battle still wages, but the battles are smaller. The confidence and trust in myself from achieving this goal means I don\u2019t need food to cover as many insecurities. And I know I can have that conversation in the moment\u2014\u201cshould I eat this?\u201d\u2014and that the outcome of the one conversation can\u2019t turn back the tide. I know that the shame from one bad choice won\u2019t dim the pride of my new life.\n\nThanks for being here for me. I rarely posted but treasured this community every day. I\u2019ll stick around for my stretch goal &amp; muscle gain coming up next. Love you guys.",

Tracking calories, or even having a food journal, triggers this behaviour in me as I\u2019m driven to run the numbers on the trends and establish whether I\u2019ve \u2018passed\u2019 or \u2018failed\u2019. I may scratch a few numbers down on a piece of paper because I struggle with mental math, but a very rough estimate is ok with me. If you track your calories religiously and this does not affect your mental health, good on ya! It\u2019s simply not for me.\n\nI refuse to approach my health and weight from a shame and hate-filled place. Approaching the mirror, old me would say \u201cLook at that tire around your waist. Just look at how gross it makes you look. Eat better today, hop on that treadmill. Get that weight off. You\u2019ll never be happy or feel loved unless you do better.\u201d I would then successfully restrict my food intake for (most of) the day, reach a point of decision fatigue, and binge until I felt emotionally better. Sometimes it would be a cycle of 8 hours, sometimes a few days, but attempting to starve myself into happiness was clearly not working. I mean, sure I lost 20 lbs in a span of 5 months, but I also gained it back (plus 10 more) in less than a month. Something clearly wasn\u2019t working.\n\nI can now ask: \u201cHey you, how do you feel? How\u2019s your energy level? Are you thirsty? Is your stomach sore? How do you feel physically with what you just ate? How does this movement make your body feel?\u201d When I look in the mirror: \u201cHey you! Nice eyes :)\u201d \u201cYou look sad\u2026What\u2019s up? Hug!\u201d\n\nHealth goals for 2016:\n\n- Eat \u2018real\u2019 foods as much as possible. Do not measure, weigh, or limit your consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit. Go wild! Your body will tell you when you\u2019ve had enough of these. When possible (ie. you have the energy and the mental well-being, you\u2019re not hungover, your choices aren\u2019t limited by circumstance or schedule), avoid refined foods and processed carbs.\nWhen time and circumstance permit, eat without digital distractions. Chew food until there are no large chunks left. Taste it! Break it down. Don\u2019t take another bite until you\u2019re done with the current one.\n\n- Go for a walk everyday at lunch. Exercise when you have the energy. Try to do a bit of stretching and/or yoga every day \u2013 even 5 minutes.\n\n- When you catch yourself saying hurtful things, particularly about the relationship between your food, your exercise, and your body image or self-worth \u2013 take pause. Question that judgement. Reframe it. How is that food going to sit in my stomach? Is my belly going to hurt all night and lead to carb cravings for breakfast? Will eating x allow me to be less stressed about my body and enjoy my evening with presence? Are you eating right now because you\u2019re bored or avoiding some negative emotions?\n\n- In all situations, make a concerted effort to be kind and have compassion toward yourself. You have the potential to hang out with your best friend 24 hours a day \u2013 get to know her! \n\nEDIT: Please note that I do not mean to advise anyone on their eating or exercise habits. This is simply a reflection of my journey - not advice! Please understand the caloric implications of fruits, especially.  I usually only eat about one piece of fruit per day, so I'm never going to actually go overboard. I'm more concious of higher calorie veggies, like tomatoes or potatoes, but I'm not going to limit my intake of dark greens like broccoli or lettuce.\n\nIt's really more of simply an understanding of my behaviour patterns along with my thought patterns. If I'm hungry enough to eat a plate of veggies (sans carbs), I'm going to be truly hungry. If I have a fridge stocked with veggies and only crave mcdonalds, I'm not hungry enough. If I'm at my calorie limit for the day, but feeling very hungry, if I don't allow myself healthy snacks (like celery or a green salad) I know I will just resort to some crap like crackers or candy.

Tracking calories, or even having a food journal, triggers this behaviour in me as I\u2019m driven to run the numbers on the trends and establish whether I\u2019ve \u2018passed\u2019 or \u2018failed\u2019. I may scratch a few numbers down on a piece of paper because I struggle with mental math, but a very rough estimate is ok with me. If you track your calories religiously and this does not affect your mental health, good on ya! It\u2019s simply not for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I refuse to approach my health and weight from a shame and hate-filled place. Approaching the mirror, old me would say \u201cLook at that tire around your waist. Just look at how gross it makes you look. Eat better today, hop on that treadmill. Get that weight off. You\u2019ll never be happy or feel loved unless you do better.\u201d I would then successfully restrict my food intake for (most of) the day, reach a point of decision fatigue, and binge until I felt emotionally better. Sometimes it would be a cycle of 8 hours, sometimes a few days, but attempting to starve myself into happiness was clearly not working. I mean, sure I lost 20 lbs in a span of 5 months, but I also gained it back (plus 10 more) in less than a month. Something clearly wasn\u2019t working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can now ask: \u201cHey you, how do you feel? How\u2019s your energy level? Are you thirsty? Is your stomach sore? How do you feel physically with what you just ate? How does this movement make your body feel?\u201d When I look in the mirror: \u201cHey you! Nice eyes :)\u201d \u201cYou look sad\u2026What\u2019s up? Hug!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Health goals for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat \u2018real\u2019 foods as much as possible. Do not measure, weigh, or limit your consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit. Go wild! Your body will tell you when you\u2019ve had enough of these. When possible (ie. you have the energy and the mental well-being, you\u2019re not hungover, your choices aren\u2019t limited by circumstance or schedule), avoid refined foods and processed carbs.\nWhen time and circumstance permit, eat without digital distractions. Chew food until there are no large chunks left. Taste it! Break it down. Don\u2019t take another bite until you\u2019re done with the current one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go for a walk everyday at lunch. Exercise when you have the energy. Try to do a bit of stretching and/or yoga every day \u2013 even 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you catch yourself saying hurtful things, particularly about the relationship between your food, your exercise, and your body image or self-worth \u2013 take pause. Question that judgement. Reframe it. How is that food going to sit in my stomach? Is my belly going to hurt all night and lead to carb cravings for breakfast? Will eating x allow me to be less stressed about my body and enjoy my evening with presence? Are you eating right now because you\u2019re bored or avoiding some negative emotions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all situations, make a concerted effort to be kind and have compassion toward yourself. You have the potential to hang out with your best friend 24 hours a day \u2013 get to know her! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Please note that I do not mean to advise anyone on their eating or exercise habits. This is simply a reflection of my journey - not advice! Please understand the caloric implications of fruits, especially.  I usually only eat about one piece of fruit per day, so I&amp;#39;m never going to actually go overboard. I&amp;#39;m more concious of higher calorie veggies, like tomatoes or potatoes, but I&amp;#39;m not going to limit my intake of dark greens like broccoli or lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really more of simply an understanding of my behaviour patterns along with my thought patterns. If I&amp;#39;m hungry enough to eat a plate of veggies (sans carbs), I&amp;#39;m going to be truly hungry. If I have a fridge stocked with veggies and only crave mcdonalds, I&amp;#39;m not hungry enough. If I&amp;#39;m at my calorie limit for the day, but feeling very hungry, if I don&amp;#39;t allow myself healthy snacks (like celery or a green salad) I know I will just resort to some crap like crackers or candy. It&amp;#39;s a matter of the lesser of two evils for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Epictetus told us that **Men are disturbed not by things themselves** but **the view which they take of them**.\n\nOur identities and the way we constantly re-frame ourselves essentially shapes our behaviour and experiences.\n\nPeople often underestimate the way words directly impact actions. \n\n**Bad habits weigh us down on our journey to moral excellence**; like an anchor, they can pull us back. It's our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. \n\nThis identity is described in the sense that \u201cmy name is John and I drink coffee often\u201d or \u201cI smoke cigarettes every day.\u201d \n\nA study published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.\n\nThere were two groups in the study, the first let\u2019s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase **\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d** both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. \n\nAs the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the \u201chealthy\u201d option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the \u201cunhealthy\u201d option). \n\nThe researchers were then measuring whether their new founded \u201cidentity\u201d would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. \n\n39 % of people who used the phrase \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. \n\nThe idea is then that **one gains greater \u201cpsychological empowerment\u201d when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.**\n\nWe can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. \n\n#Decision fatigue\n\nWe like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.\n\nVeganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).\n\nSome people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. \n\n**Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.**\n\nIn studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).\n\nThere\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. \n\nThis means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates\n\n#Don\u2019t count days. \n\nAnother idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. \n\n**NEVER count days.** Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a \"smoker who went 40 days without it\" or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d\n\n**Every habit is triggered by some event.** For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. \n\nI found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. \n\nThen I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. \n\nThis helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.\n\nThe point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. \n\nTaken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9\n\n#[Watch This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;t)\n\n**Sources:**\n\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions\n\n(1) http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full",

A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Decision fatigue&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than \u201ceating healthier\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Veganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, I\u2019m simply proving a point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people may have had difficulty in following a \u201chealthy diet\u201d and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc\u2026come to save the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d (1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s less decision in the moment of \u201cshould I eat that\u201d if your deontology allows you too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans \u201cmore extreme\u201d which can hold a high emotional investment into the \u201ccause\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.\u201d\n- Socrates&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Don\u2019t count days.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop \u201ccounting days\u201d this is a similar strategy as saying I can\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER count days.&lt;/strong&gt; Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a &amp;quot;smoker who went 40 days without it&amp;quot; or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every habit is triggered by some event.&lt;/strong&gt; For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two \u2014 if I smoked, I\u2019d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don\u2019t realise you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken from Philip Ghezelbash \u00a9&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhRkcz6wOGQ&amp;amp;t\"&gt;Watch This Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Extraneous factors in judicial decisions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full\"&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm not blaming her for the weight gain as at the end of the day I made the choices to stuff myself constantly, with or without her. Anyway, we broke up (mutual and as amicable as possible) as of last week and in the week I've been single, I can already feel a difference just by eating right and exercising. I went from 180 to 219 over 11 months... probably tipped over 220 at some point but I was too scared to look after I saw 219. I weighed in at 212 this past Monday and will weigh myself tomorrow for my weekly check-in. I had a pretty good week although I did treat myself to a \"break up pizza\" on Tuesday which I spread over 3 days. (4 slices Tuesday dinner, 2 slices Wednesday lunch, last 2 slices Thursday lunch). Obviously not doing that every week and made an exception as a treat (I love pizza like you wouldn't believe, lol, so this will be the hardest sacrifice -- I'll still treat myself to appropriate portions going forward though, but definitely can't be ordering it once a week/every 10 days like I did in months past...)\n\nI can't wait to see the progress I make. I know it's not going to be overnight and I likely won't see semi-drastic results until mid September or so (i.e. a month from now). I'll probably be losing weight into January 2019 because I have 30+ pounds to drop. Taking the mindset of slow and steady but watching my calories too. I want to get to 165. I'm about 5'6\" and a half. I've always been a bigger person. I got down to 172.7 at my peak in 2016 but relaxed, treated myself to a cheat day that became a cheat week and before I knew it, I was back in the 180s. I just could never seem to get under that 170 mark. But I'm determined this time once and for all. But first, I need to get back under the 200 pound mark.\n\nWish me luck! I know this is a marathon, not a sprint, and you can't do it on willpower alone because of decision fatigue. It's gotta be habits! I've been watching tons of health-related videos on YouTube to get behind the science of weight loss or just plain motivational videos about losing weight -- shout out to Matt Cama! His videos are always inspirational.\n\nSo, anyone else went on a lifestyle change/diet post break up? How did it go? ",

I picked up some bad eating habits but it&amp;#39;s certainly my fault as well. I&amp;#39;m not blaming her for the weight gain as at the end of the day I made the choices to stuff myself constantly, with or without her. Anyway, we broke up (mutual and as amicable as possible) as of last week and in the week I&amp;#39;ve been single, I can already feel a difference just by eating right and exercising. I went from 180 to 219 over 11 months... probably tipped over 220 at some point but I was too scared to look after I saw 219. I weighed in at 212 this past Monday and will weigh myself tomorrow for my weekly check-in. I had a pretty good week although I did treat myself to a &amp;quot;break up pizza&amp;quot; on Tuesday which I spread over 3 days. (4 slices Tuesday dinner, 2 slices Wednesday lunch, last 2 slices Thursday lunch). Obviously not doing that every week and made an exception as a treat (I love pizza like you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe, lol, so this will be the hardest sacrifice -- I&amp;#39;ll still treat myself to appropriate portions going forward though, but definitely can&amp;#39;t be ordering it once a week/every 10 days like I did in months past...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to see the progress I make. I know it&amp;#39;s not going to be overnight and I likely won&amp;#39;t see semi-drastic results until mid September or so (i.e. a month from now). I&amp;#39;ll probably be losing weight into January 2019 because I have 30+ pounds to drop. Taking the mindset of slow and steady but watching my calories too. I want to get to 165. I&amp;#39;m about 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; and a half. I&amp;#39;ve always been a bigger person. I got down to 172.7 at my peak in 2016 but relaxed, treated myself to a cheat day that became a cheat week and before I knew it, I was back in the 180s. I just could never seem to get under that 170 mark. But I&amp;#39;m determined this time once and for all. But first, I need to get back under the 200 pound mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck! I know this is a marathon, not a sprint, and you can&amp;#39;t do it on willpower alone because of decision fatigue. It&amp;#39;s gotta be habits! I&amp;#39;ve been watching tons of health-related videos on YouTube to get behind the science of weight loss or just plain motivational videos about losing weight -- shout out to Matt Cama! His videos are always inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, anyone else went on a lifestyle change/diet post break up? How did it go? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I started competitive CrossFit several years later, where, despite my big size (I was about 240 - which is HUGE for a CrossFit athlete) I attained a moderate amount of success for that time (the sport has progressed tremendously since then). Most recently, I became an olympic weightlifter and focused exclusively on strength training in the 105+ KG class (heavyweight). During this time I got strong as a horse - and nearly as big. Because, as a general rule, the bigger you are the easier it is to lift heavy weights, I ended up getting up to 285# at the peak of my competitive career. In all of these endeavors, I always seemed to succeed not because of my size, but despite it. Somehow I could force my body to keep up enough to do well, despite the fact that in many of these instances I was well above what would be considered a competitive weight. \n\nI've since retired and have now decided my #1 fitness goal should be reducing my overall body weight and improving my body composition. In some ways I'm at quite an advantage - I have a lean body mass of almost 210 pounds, so I burn a TON of calories each day, which makes eating below my TDEE much easier than someone who is 5'0 and weighs 130#. I have also been weight training for 17 years and thoroughly enjoy working out, so I find myself doing CrossFit or intense yoga 5-6 days a week. \n\nWhat has been very challenging is the marked and sometimes drastic loss in strength I have experienced as a result of cutting my calories significantly. When I could eat whatever I wanted and was training full time, I could squat 500# - now I'm lucky if I squat 80% of that. I know these numbers seem ridiculous but, as someone who has chased performance over all else my whole life, this has been an extremely hard pill to swallow. I recognize that it's part of the journey, that I'm sacrificing some things (like strength) to gain other things (lifelong health and fitness), but it is still difficult at times to get my ego to abide.  \n\nIn any case, I've found success so far in a few things:\n1. I weigh myself every day, no matter what I ate the day before. In the past I had success with quantifying my information, but as soon as I had a day or weekend where I had a major binge, I'd fear the scale the following day. This would lead to the next day, and the next, until I had fallen completely off the bandwagon. Now the scale is my accountabilibuddy - and I never miss a day if I can.\n\n2. I skip breakfast. I'm usually hungry, sometimes ravenous, from 6-noon, especially because I work out first thing in the AM - but I've made the decision to simply never have breakfast, ever. Although it seems like this would be difficult, by deciding right out that I wasn't going to eat breakfast, I don't even have to consider making a good choice for food - the choice has been made. \n\n3. I eat the same thing every day for lunch. Again, it helps with decision fatigue and ensures I don't break my fast with a binge. \n\n4. I eat whatever I want for dinner as long as I stay within my calorie budget. I have done a handful of paleo challenges and while they were extremely effective, they were INCREDIBLY hard to stick with - so much so that food became one of the main focuses of my life. Now, if I want Dairy Queen - I get dairy queen, but I stick with a small size and make sure I don't go overboard for the day. \n\nAnyway, hope this might be helpful to other big guys and gals in the forum. I've been known as \"the big guy\" my whole life, and I'm working on turning that around. ",

I'm totally stunned, and very pleased. I'm 6'0, and my goal is 165-170, so I'm on track for being at my goal sometime early-ish next year, which is fine by me.\n\nI did three things that really seemed to have helped as compared to previous numerous attempts to lose weight:\n\n1) I enlisted my wife in my eating and weight-loss plans; she's not doing the same thing as me, but what she's doing is the compatible, less tough version.\n\n2) After reading about decision fatigue here and elsewhere, I decided to just decide once that I was doing this. I didn't want to have to keep asking myself \"should I eat that?\" over and over. So, I just decided to do it, end of story, point blank.\n\n3) I went Paleo, which I love. Well, a sort of modernized Paleo with a cheat day and low-sugar-content milk products OK. The blood sugar management was the hardest for me, so Paleo works great.\n\nI figured I would try just a diet change for the first two or so months, and I'm picking up some sports slowly, aiming at doing a sprint or olympic tri by the end of the summer.\n\nAnyway, I'm a lurker here, but I've been totally inspired reading people's stories, and helped by all the successes. Nice work, all, and yay to me. I'm looking forward to spending more money on clothes yet again soon.",
