Looking into replacing our 10+ yr old S+F Thurston House plush Euro top Queen for a king.\n\nI've done a fair amount of Internet research at this point, but have seen about as many positive as negative posts about every bed that looks interesting,, and there are so many seemingly equal options out there... I'm getting decision fatigue. I promise that my wife is also fatigued by my decision process \ud83d\ude02\n\nHoping for some guidance on how to narrow down our choices so that we can have a finite list to compare and don't feel like we're missing anything.\n\nThings about us that might help in a recommendation:\n\n-I am 5'9\" 160-180 lbs, wife is 5'7\" somewhere 200-250\n\n-both side sleepers or side/ back combo\n\n-i only have minor back stiffness, wife has moderate back/hip/shoulder/neck pain, restless legs, sleeps hot\n\n-We went to mattress firm a few weeks ago and were both intrigued by Tempur pedic and purple.\n\n-open to spending whatever is needed, but don't want to spend more than I need to for a great option. We see this as an investment, I want to make sure it's the best one / the right one\n\n-we belong to Costco, am interested in both the TP and Purple options they have there\n\n-we both like a soft feeling mattress\n\nAppreciate your recommendations!",

I aim to sleep on my back during the night but do end up on my side occasionally. Recently, I bought the Purple original mattress since I thought firmer would be best, but I hate it and returning it. I have a memory foam topper on it now which makes it more comfy, but pain still wakes me up. I\u2019m considering a traditional pillow top mattress like the Wink or Saatva, but I\u2019m so confused with decision fatigue on the never ending choices \ud83d\ude23. I\u2019ve watched endless Slumber Yard etc videos and still unsure. Would really appreciate any insight! Thx",

I aim to sleep on my back during the night but do end up on my side occasionally. Recently, I bought the Purple original mattress since I thought firmer would be best, but I hate it and returning it. I have a memory foam topper on it now which makes it more comfy, but pain still wakes me up. I\u2019m considering a traditional pillow top mattress like the Wink or Saatva, but I\u2019m so confused with decision fatigue on the never ending choices \ud83d\ude23. I\u2019ve watched endless Slumber Yard etc videos and still unsure. Would really appreciate any insight! Thx&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm 190 and 5'6, and a variable sleeper (mostly stomach, some side). We're both in our 40s, no major pressure points or illnesses... at least, not yet. Looking to spend under $1000.\n\nThe major tangle is this: We want the Cal King size, because of husband's unfortunate tallness; his legs hang off our Queen and it's starting to impact his back. But we're heading overseas for work, where Cal King beds are very much not a thing, so if we get something that disintegrates we can't replace it easily until we come back to the US in 3-5 years.\n\nInitially, we were thinking a 100% memory foam bed, because husband wants something he can sink into and I love the idea of movement isolation and lack of 'bounce'. (Best sleep of my life was in Nepal on a 100% cotton futon on top of a wooden plank. I am NOT about the bounce!) but now I'm really worried about the mattress holding up under our weight and sagging/falling apart/getting depressions where we sleep and being stuck with it. \n\nSo, my question is... is a Hybrid going to be any better as far as durability? The big selling point for a hybrid seems to be that old-fashioned mattress feel with the bounce, which is like an anti-selling point for me. I can put up with it, though, if it gives us better durability. The other option seems like it would be latex. I'm not sure, though... would latex help -- and if so, how much would we need before we saw a difference? I love the idea of a latex mattress, but weight is definitely a concern since we can only send a certain amount of our belongings overseas and that's measured by weight and not volume, and latex is heavy stuff. \n\nThoughts? Recommendations? I'd love to hear any tips or ideas ya'll have to share.",
