I take pictures of dogs and people. If I go on a trip I might take pictures of cool stuff I see (like the animals) but these days, most cameras are pretty good for what I would use them for. \n\nStorage: Big deal. I decided to get 64gb last time and have regrets. I was heartbroken when the Moto Edge didn\u2019t work because it had 512gb and I was really impressed. \n\nBattery capacity: the longer the better, this is a top priority \n\nBattery charge time: the shorter the better, also a too priority\n\nDurability: I\u2019m an idiot and drop my phone a lot so yeah, it needs to be hardy or have some good case options. \n\nWireless charging: in my experience wireless charging doesn\u2019t work near as well as regular charging so I don\u2019t care about this either\n\nCarrier: AT&amp;T prepaid, so I will be buying this phone upfront and unlocked (there\u2019s a possibility I will switch to TMobile in the near future but that\u2019s not entirely up to me and is yet to be determined)\n\nProcessing speed: I like gaming so this is pretty important \n\nPrice point: I would like to not pay over $800. I realize the S23 Ultra doesn\u2019t quite fit here, but yesterday it was on sale, and I\u2019ve already written this whole post about it and I still think it\u2019s worth posting to see what people think. \n\nOther considerations: I have had a one plus phone before (oneplus6) and I liked it quite a bit. The last time I had a Samsung phone I think I was in high school. I switch between apps constantly, I\u2019m on my phone a lot, I\u2019m 25 and work in marketing. Take all that for what you will. Vote between these two or suggest me one that you think will be a better fit.",
