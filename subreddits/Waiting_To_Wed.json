He's Asian American, and I'm a South Asian immigrant.\n\nHere's the backstory: my family has been pushing for an arranged marriage for the past 2 years, but I've always believed in finding genuine connections. I was single for 3 years before meeting my boyfriend.\n\nMy bf on the other hand comes from background where marriage after 35 is common\n\nAfter a month, I asked for exclusivity, though he seemed more invested. Six months in, I said \"I love you\" first, despite knowing he showed it through actions. Three months in, I opened up about my family's involvement in my marriage prospects, and he assured me of his commitment to our relationship and I stopped entertaining my family. \n\nAfter 1 year and 8 months, we agreed on a timeline to marry when I turn 30. However, with my work permit issues looming I am leaving the country. He hasn't initiated any conversation about our future. I've dropped hints and nudged him to discuss engagement or marriage, but he hasn't shown any excitement.\n\nEverytime I bring this topic up he says that he really wants to marry me, we\u2019re a good team and that he will be better at communicating. \n\nI turn 30 in 8 months, and I'm at a crossroads. I'm ready for commitment, but he seems like he is not ready. He's not emotionally expressive and struggles with decisions, though he's hardworking and respectful.\n\nI'm torn between my love for him and my desire for a committed future. Is this just decision fatigue, or is there something deeper? I love him and can't see a future with anyone else. Any advice or insights would be appreciated.",
