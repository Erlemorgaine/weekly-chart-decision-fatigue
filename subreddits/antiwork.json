I\u2019m in a pretty significant transitional period with my career and I\u2019m honestly just burnt out with my current role. I work in human services with children with disabilities. It\u2019s rewarding work but it never ends. There is no clear end of the work day or start of the next. It\u2019s constant, ongoing decision making for others who need you and I\u2019m exhausted honestly. I can\u2019t even focus on my own family and my own home because I\u2019m constantly making decisions for others and being needed. I work from home, client files are kept at home, and the line between work and life is so blurred it really doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ve contemplated suicide just to end this feeling. I\u2019m out of that space but I still need a solution. Not to mention I\u2019m in graduate school online, full time. \n\nSo now I\u2019m thinking if I quit this job at the beginning or middle of April, I\u2019ll have about a month off to finish up school and just do... nothing. My field is in pretty high demand and I think I could easily secure a job in about a month or so when I start looking. I just need a break. If my partner and I keep our typical spending habits and nothing catastrophic happens, we would need less than half of what is currently in my savings account for me to not work April-June, we could also probably be more conservative with our spending and I\u2019d be saving so much on gas and car maintenance (I currently drive about 350 miles a week to client homes). If our tax returns come on time, we wouldn\u2019t even need to touch my savings. Then, ideally, I can find a contract position that pays enough for me to only need to work part time. \n\nIs this plan reasonable? My partner is supportive but I think he\u2019s just being nice because I am on the verge of breaking and he doesn\u2019t want to push me over by challenging this. I don\u2019t want to end up homeless. We have a ton of family nearby that I could lean on. Worst case scenario we\u2019d move in with my parents if I can\u2019t find a job. I feel like this is my only option right now. \n\nI need a break or this is going to kill me. I\u2019m burnt out, I have decision fatigue and it\u2019s driving me into compassion fatigue, which is a death sentence for the field I\u2019m in. I get anxious when my phone rings or buzzes with a call/text/email. I\u2019m currently avoiding getting ready for my next client. I\u2019m not built to do this every day. I know I need a break before I move into a more senior role. Any advice or encouragement is welcomed.",
