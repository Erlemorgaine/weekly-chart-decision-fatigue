We both work and do a really good job of splitting household chores and childcare. BUT the mental load for staying on top of family activities falls primarily on me. Things like scheduling the kids dr appointments, school theme days or events, birthdays or special activities , planning the meals for the week , etc primarily stay with me. He\u2019s great about taking the kids to their appointments or events or going grocery shopping once I have them scheduled in the calendar or a list made but if I don\u2019t make the plans , they don\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve talked about how I need him to take over the initiative on schedule or planning these types of activities but he always counters with that he\u2019s happy to help with any of these thing but they aren\u2019t as important to him so if the kids don\u2019t have a gift for teacher appreciation day at daycare or aren\u2019t dressed up for the theme party or we give gift cards instead of buying presents for family he\u2019s okay with that. I\u2019m not. So I end up still doing all the mental labor to to make sure everything is organized &amp; scheduled in the calendar &amp; gift ideas planned out because it matters to me that these things are done. But my job also requires me to be making decision all day every day for my team and it\u2019s gotten to the point that by the end of the day I\u2019m just tired of making decisions. I\u2019d like for just one day to come home from work and find out that he\u2019s planned out the grocery list or at least has a couple meal ideas ready or that he saw the note from daycare about the muffins with mom celebration and put it in the calendar so we didn\u2019t miss it. \n\nI usually do okay dealing with my frustration around this issue as at the end of the day our actual division of labor/childcare/house chores is pretty evenly split it\u2019s just the planning and organizing that falls squarely on me. This really came to a head as Mother\u2019s Day is coming up and he wanted me to give him a list of gift ideas and activities I wanted to do to celebrate and what meal or restaurant I want that day. I\u2019m honestly at the point right now where I\u2019d rather not celebrate Mother\u2019s Day if it\u2019s just going to be another thing I have to plan. I get that he wants to make sure that I get gifts I like and that we do a family activity I\u2019m excited for and I know once I tell him what I want to do or eat or go, he\u2019ll take over and buy the gifts, make the reservation etc to plan the rest of the day but the thought of having to plan a celebration that supposed to be for me makes me want to cry.\n\nI guess I just need an outside perspective on if I\u201dm being unreasonable in wanting him to take over some of making the plans not just the execution of the plans\u2026.. any tips on how to get this across to him as every time we\u2019ve talked about it as ended up with us both frustrated with the other and nothing really changes.

Especially when most of our friends have kids and few babysitters. Should I do a party with kids? We do hang out at our homes but usually in warmer weather where we can be outdoors and playing and hanging out instead of crammed in my house. I\u2019m not usually indecisive and I think what throws me and what I\u2019ve always hated is a winter birthday when options are limited and our friend group is all in the same stage with small kids.
