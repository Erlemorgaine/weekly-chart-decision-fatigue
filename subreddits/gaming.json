This was meant to be a quick rant, but since it got some attention, I decided to give this a bit more thought.\n\nIf you like this MTX model, and want to get some insights on why many people, like me, don't, give this a read.\n\nIt definitely seems like I'm not the only person who is uncomfortable with micro-transactions, so I did some reflections on why I feel this way about them. Some of the other people who also dislike them might feel the same, and this might help explain to you folks who are in favor of MTX what makes them attract so much negative attention whereas expansions usually don't.\n\nI think it breaks down to mostly two things:\n* Decision fatigue when buying games.\n* Being constantly reminded that you didn't *actually* buy the game\n\nLet me explain further:\n\nWhen you're buying a game that has a bunch of DLC, and some bundles (say, \"ultimate version\"), you need to make choices on _how_ you want to buy the game. Should you buy the base game and then buy characters you think you'd like? But then, maybe there's a discount on the bundle over there. But it includes two characters that you don't really want, so you may be better off buying that other bundle there and buying the three characters from that other bundle individually...\n\nOverall, it adds a lot of possibilities of \"ways to buy\", and honestly, I don't have time for this. I just want to buy the game and play it. That's it. Yes, I could just buy the \"ultimate edition\" bundle, but often it's not even that evident.\n\nThen there's the constant reminder. When you're playing some games with expansions, when done right, you wouldn't even know there is an expansion from within the game. Maybe, only if you're navigating in a menu where you can toggle these things on or off.\n\nWith some DLC and MTX formats, you get e.g. the character locked in the character selection screen, constantly reminding you that your game isn't really \"complete\". Yes, I know these were added after the game was launched, but that's history - looking at the game *now* it doesn't feel complete with the characters locked. Some games give you goddamn notifications within the game itself about new skins. I logged in Diablo, not Slack, for fuck's sake.\n\nWhen I see the characters locked in the character screen I don't feel an urge to buy the DLC.\n\nI want to put the game down and rant about it on Reddit.",
