First I thought I wanted a tinyhome... then it was a little pull behind trailer (airstream caravel), got quotes for 2 custom van conversions, hunted for used conversions, considered a truck topper camper..now I am considering maybe a class C?! Good lord. I HAVE done the research folks lol this may be a personal problem and just decision fatigue, perfectionism, and difficulty with risk-taking. I have downsized alot already and have been staying in very small spaces to prep. I would love to pull the trigger on something! To be frank, I feel like I am getting too old to float around and staying in my current state is going to really take a toll on me if I don't make a decision.\n\nMy family doesnt fully support this. Dad thinks I am foolish for spending money on something that will depreciate-Mom thinks deflecting her fear on me.\n\nIf anyone could please take the time to give me their take if they relate with my situation; I need some direction or insight from someone who has been through this- or knows what wont be a good option would even help steer me !\n\nWhat I am looking for/what to factor into decision: \n\nMy goal is to do this 1-2 years Full time with breaks as needed; traveling to find somewhere to live/invest. \n\nI have family and good friends (and a bed/home for breaks) in OR, MT, CA, AZ, and FL, and have thought about snagging friends and fam to bring with me on little weekend trips as part of my plans.  \n\nTherefore, I see myself mainly driving to/or nearby towns/small cities I want to explore-those of which have recreation (hiking, biking) nearby. \n\nThat being said, I will likely stay at rest stops, walmarts etc. To travel to destination towns. Once to destination, I'd stay at campground or state park to set up shop for the week, explore the community scene, restaurants, etc. Weekends I would explore the nearby recreation dabbling with boondocking over the 3 day weekend (while also dabbling with my internet capabilities to see if they can handle the demands of job-in case i like boondocking and want to transition to working there). Sunday travel to new town to do it again.\n\nCould go two ways here: boondock camp and drive into towns to explore vs RV camp drive to outskirts on weekends. Mind numbing to try and determine what will be my preference. Have no clue. \n\nI would be working Mon-Thur, 30-40 hours inside of the rig for about 70% of those hours on live zoom, as my work requires me to be in a private space. 30% I would like to sit outside as able.\n \nI will have an electric bike.\n\nI want a toilet, shower, an ergonomic work set up and ability to cook.\n\nI will say there is something eerie to me about being in the middle of the woods and not reallyyyy knowing if no one is there. Both if sitting outside, cooking with door open, recreating from BLM. And if I ever got a knock boondocking. I . Would. Die. At a campground I would not be scared of this situation.   Am I tripping about something that I shouldn't ?\n\nThat being said, I will not scimp on security measures. Motion lights, alarms, cameras, weapon.\n\nMy hang ups: \nTT: A small pull behind trailer may  have the room I may find I need for so much time spent in rig working at desk Mon-TR. Like idea of taking off in truck to explore town during week or weekends. May not do well off road-however I am not sure how rough of spots I will come across? Could get an off road one? Big con safety wise, can't jump in driver seat and take off... \n\nVan: super expensive new, hard to find used with exactly what you want/need, the airstream ones I have been in feel pretty narrow and cramped? Worried with work in there itll be confining. Honestly what put me onto vans was being able to leave a scary situation without going outside. \n\nClass C:  a small one (Mercedes /transit front end) couldddd work, but definitely no boondocking, so this is a no, right? \n\nTruck topper: Pro-cheaper. Any other positives Im not considering? Sounds uncomfortable to drive/manuever with my little experience...\n\nIf a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. \n\nI super appreciate anyones advice with this. I have completely uprooted my life in AK to make this transition. I have been living in families small guest spaces, and a set of storage bins for almost a year now, and just need a consistent space of my own. I have been stuck between making a wise sound decision while also trying to move forward with my dream/life. :)\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all who are helping provide some advice! :)\n\nBudget: I would like to stay below 100k, ideally, but could get a loan and go higher for right circumstance. If a wiser decision happens to be a more expensive model/option, thats okay as long as it means I'm happy and saves me money in long wrong. Aka if its expensive and it holds its value I will be less anxious about it. For example, if I can get most of money back from a custom van conversion, I would consider it. \n\nI've seen used van conversions for 80-100k with most of my needs. I'm prepared to upgrade as needed. \n\nId need to buy a truck and pull behind trailer if I went that route.  \n\nI have done research on internet needs and it seems with increased tethering with 1-2 unlimited phone plans, mimo antenna, and starlink back up, I should find good internet somewhere! Not planning on depending on open internet options i.e. campgrounds.",
