I'm now 5 months PP and wanted to share some things I would tell a close friend who's expecting for the first time.\n\nDeclutter, organise, simplify your home and belongings before baby arrives. I believe there's a serious reason a lot of us experience \"nesting\". Purge your bathroom - facial toners that have been sitting on your shelf for 2 years? Expensive cream that cost so much you can't throw it out even though you never use it? Clutter adds to stress.\n\nWhen baby arrived, I felt more out of control than ever before in my life. Suddenly I wasn't in charge: my wake-ups and bedtime, when I got time to eat or go out, everything's about the baby for at least the first few months. It's much easier to do self care when all that's on the shelf is a couple of products that you actually use and enjoy, that don't give you decision fatigue.\n\nSame idea with never worn clothes in your wardrobe. They're only going to add to stress, especially if you've got something hanging there that was too small even before you were pregnant. \n\nI really think doing a big purge and going through all your belongings (think of it as your inventory), before baby arrives will make you feel more peaceful and in control of your environment, when all else will seem like pure chaos.",

I&amp;#39;m now 5 months PP and wanted to share some things I would tell a close friend who&amp;#39;s expecting for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Declutter, organise, simplify your home and belongings before baby arrives. I believe there&amp;#39;s a serious reason a lot of us experience &amp;quot;nesting&amp;quot;. Purge your bathroom - facial toners that have been sitting on your shelf for 2 years? Expensive cream that cost so much you can&amp;#39;t throw it out even though you never use it? Clutter adds to stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When baby arrived, I felt more out of control than ever before in my life. Suddenly I wasn&amp;#39;t in charge: my wake-ups and bedtime, when I got time to eat or go out, everything&amp;#39;s about the baby for at least the first few months. It&amp;#39;s much easier to do self care when all that&amp;#39;s on the shelf is a couple of products that you actually use and enjoy, that don&amp;#39;t give you decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same idea with never worn clothes in your wardrobe. They&amp;#39;re only going to add to stress, especially if you&amp;#39;ve got something hanging there that was too small even before you were pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really think doing a big purge and going through all your belongings (think of it as your inventory), before baby arrives will make you feel more peaceful and in control of your environment, when all else will seem like pure chaos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If not I\u2019m seriously considering C section even though this was definitely not something I wanted or planned on doing. I\u2019m just really tired and exhausted by those last few days of trying absolutely everything (from acupuncture, exercise and teas to oils and intimacy, I did it all). \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do and having contractions that might not lead anywhere for another 2-3 days sound just so so terrible .. \n\nRecovering from a C section also sounds terrible \ud83e\udee0 \n\nAny advice or helpful stories are very much appreciated. \ud83e\udd72\n\nThank you! \n\nEdit: also the risk of a stillbirth rises extremely by week 42 so this is also quite stressful to think about ..

If not I\u2019m seriously considering C section even though this was definitely not something I wanted or planned on doing. I\u2019m just really tired and exhausted by those last few days of trying absolutely everything (from acupuncture, exercise and teas to oils and intimacy, I did it all). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don\u2019t know what to do and having contractions that might not lead anywhere for another 2-3 days sound just so so terrible .. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recovering from a C section also sounds terrible \ud83e\udee0 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice or helpful stories are very much appreciated. \ud83e\udd72&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: also the risk of a stillbirth rises extremely by week 42 so this is also quite stressful to think about .. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm concerned especially since he's had some success since it only has a lap belt and no shoulder straps to keep him contained to the seat.\n\nI have been doing so much research trying to find the perfect high chair for my needs that I've got decision fatigue. I wanted to know what any of you have found to be the best high chairs you would recommend? If it's helpful I've listed below the criteria most important to me in the high chair:\n\n**Must-Haves:**\n\n\\#1 Easy to clean\n\n\\#2 sturdy/safe (5 point harness belt and we plan to hold onto the chair for multiple children)\n\n\\#3 comfortable for baby (has a footrest and padded seat available)\n\n**Bonus Items: (not necessary, but would be nice if these were in addition to the must-haves)**\n\n\\-Easy to store away when not in use\n\n\\-Can recline for when baby is drinking\n\n\\-Wheels to move it around\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit- Son is 10 months old and we do not have a kitchen table/chairs, we eat at our kitchen island",
