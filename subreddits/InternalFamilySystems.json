I struggle with a lot of generalized and social anxiety...\n\nthis basically boils down to feeling the need to choose between home improvements, buying new things like pants but also from me somewhat hurting inside and wanting a new pc mid-prace range that can run games so I can relax and have adventures of the mind besides taking care of life, body and hobbies I want to pursue for certain too. There is an old core of addiction inside me because computer games were one of the few things that made me cope in the past through school and my parents place and I do miss roaming fantasy worlds and seeing the art and beauty of them. The defining difference between now and then is that I can go outside and not fear for my physical safety. I am aware that it is escapism in its core as is reading fiction books and I do not know how much I can view it as grounding and relaxing... there might be a part that would like to put up tent in such a world and live there indefinitely because it had a warming effect on my in the absence of other things in my past.\n\nOn the other side is me not for very much longer having the option to sign up for all the steps to go a journey abroad to work and travel, meet new people and hopefully have a good time and great experiences. I have certainly become scared of it after some time initiating some steps towards it because it feels so big and uncertain and I have chronic illnesses. A few years back I did a road tour to Spain through a few other countries too and took pain meds every single day during all of it I think because it was impossible to take enough care of my body's needs the way the journey was set to be taken by my companions on the road and my professor's guidelines at the destination.\n\nAnd daily life has been two opposing wants and needs battling for hierarchy inside me. The one who rather reclines and sees the green grass on this patch here and improving the space I have for certain for now today vs the one who wants to reach out and expand, have adventures, wants to believe that that is the missing piece to reduce the pain condition and other countries could come close to healing me and that not opting for this the more and more, day by day disappearing chance to work&amp;travel is me giving up wanting to broaden my world and simply be out there - which feels like a certain loss too.\n\nComing close to actually buying the pc spare parts makes me freeze and feel horrible, putting that aside and deciding to go and continue the steps for work&amp;travel does the same and rises a different fear as well as overhwelm. I do not know if this is also a depression problem with it being decision fatigue perhaps, simply the impossibility to choose one thing for certain because deciding for one feels completely fatal.\n\nTl;dr: starting to believe I am losing my mind. The instant I am close to buying pc spare parts or improving other areas of my living space I freeze and cannot do it and feel disgust and then do not but keep thinking that abroad travel and work is better, the next day I am back to step one. + I lose so much time going back and forth on this but am unable to make a clear decision that feels just right",
