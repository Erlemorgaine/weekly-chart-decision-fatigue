I wanted to preface this by saying I am primarily leaning towards exclusively pumping (and I do understand the nuance of what it CAN do to your sanity of having to clean parts constantly/bring a bunch of stuff with you when you aren't at home, etc.)  but I am not 100% set on a feeding method yet though; however, because my insurance covers a pump, I was like what the heck, why not. I have been lurking in the exclusively pumping subreddit, but I find that a lot of their recommendations are on pumps that aren't really easy to get in Canada and the more I search the more brands I end up discovering. I think currently I am stuck on a few options with portability/mobility being a HUGE factor along with accessibility to additional pump parts here in Canada (so I am not considering anything that requires me to sit plugged to a wall; although my husband asked me why I wouldn't wanna sit down in one spot when I wanna pump haha, I just like the idea of being able to move around IF needed. Not to mention just thinking about our couch, the outlet spots are a little awkward and inconvenient.)\n\nSpectra S1/S2 - heard primarily amazing things, only a small amount of people said suction was too strong/that the pump hurt, however, the off putting thing is that if purchased via Amazon to be shipped here, there is another thread where someone mentioned the warranty is not valid in Canada, which basically means if anything breaks or doesn't work down the road in the near future, I feel like I am just hooped. Or am I just making too big a deal out of this and that this pump don't typically fail so it's a minute risk that people often take in Canada?\n\nMedela Freestyle Flex - for some reason only BestBuy sells this one; all other stores will only sell the freestyle with the wearable cups although if I wanna spend some money on those pricey af wearable cups this is best of both worlds? However, I think I am letting the reviews perhaps get TOO into my head with newer Medela products in general but can't discount it when there are so many mentioning the same thing across all their different products that the pump motor or something with the pump failed within months, which is surprising to me because Medela has been a trusted brand for many years. The saving grace is that everyone DOES say the warranty is great, things get replaced very quickly, but I would imagine there is still some sort of lag time between the warranty claim vs. actually getting the parts to my door, so what would I do meanwhile? Use a manual pump? (I do have one single Medela Harmony and a few Haaka lady bug catchers primarily for let down.)\n\nWearables (Willow Go/Elvie - which the latter is attractive because I can get just one side for occasional pumping but not yet sold in Canada directly once again so likely have the same warranty issue? Plus the ONE side of the Elvie is almost the cost of some double pumps here) - these are NEVER recommended as primary due to less suction power therefore not emptying milk as well, but I am getting a little confused by the difference between Willow advertising themselves as hospital grade suction vs. the other pumps people recommend. Does hospital grade have a large range? Is it just a marketing gimmick these days? Or are they just not as good because they simply don't fit as well? Either way, I don't feel like I would drop that kind of price to use it as an occasional pump. Maybe I am being stubborn that maybe I can be in the minor percentage that can successfully use it as a primary just because they look nice and discreet but I feel like this is for the time being more bougie than useful.\n\nThanks for listening to my perhaps presumably useless ramblings going on in my head as I am weeks away from my due date :P",
