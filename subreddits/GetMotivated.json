I want a doctor that\u2019s going to encourage me to be more active and help me set goals and action plans. I want a doctor that\u2019s going to be proactive, not reactive. My wife had to *tell* her doctors what she thought was wrong with her a couple years ago before they even considered it. And even then they didn\u2019t run diagnostics until a few visits later. \n\n- Finding a therapist\n\nI tried BetterHelp during the pandemic, went through three therapists before even meeting them, and gave up. I reached out to a therapist group recently, and they called me back a couple weeks ago, but I haven\u2019t returned the call. \n\n- Getting active\n\nWhere do I even start? Strength is important, so is VO2 max, and then there\u2019s this whole food thing, and how you should be fueling your body appropriately\u2026 Running is bad on the body, but better than nothing. I can\u2019t even begin to learn all that! And again, time! Energy is also a big one. I leave for work at 5:15, and get home around 4:30 PM. I\u2019m tired and unmotivated. \n\n- Making meals\n\nMy wife has been doing 99% of all meal making and grocery shopping for a decade. I want to help more, especially since I get home before she does. I\u2019m not a great cook - I don\u2019t know a lot about fats and starches and stuff, or how to make a balanced meal, or how to make something from what\u2019s in the fridge. \n\nI\u2019ve asked her to leave recipes for me, but she hasn\u2019t. She\u2019s left names of dishes, but those are somewhere in a recipe book, or in her brain. I think at this point she feels that it\u2019s less work to just do it herself than to create a system that I can work with. And I feel bad if I press her on it because her time is so limited. \n\nHow do functioning adults do all of this?",

I have a perfect timeslot after I return from my workout and before my shower. I'm even wearing my workout shoes! Easy right?\n\nI hold the routine for 2 months and now my brain is fighting back \"But we did that yesterday!\" \"We can do it later\" \"We can skip, he'll be fine\". \n\nHe won't be fine. If I avoid walking him, he gets destructive.\n\nSame issue now with diet journaling. At some point it became a \"task\" and I'm fighting with my grey matter every time I think I should log my food. \n\nEdit: thanks for the suggestions and commentary! I do think It's a matter of making several decisions at once and assembling the whole task of what it means \"to walk the dog\". Do I walk the whole neighborhood, half of it, or just around the block? Should I have a jacket, or can I manage without? Instead of all of that (maybe still need the jacket question) I should focus on \"get the harness on the dog\" because once he's in it, we're walking. \nAnother suggestion of finding a source of dopamine to look forward to is another good one I'll look into. \n\nTo those who effectively say \"do it anyway\" \"have discipline\", etc...I want to punch you in the face for your self-righteous assholery.

I have a perfect timeslot after I return from my workout and before my shower. I&amp;#39;m even wearing my workout shoes! Easy right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hold the routine for 2 months and now my brain is fighting back &amp;quot;But we did that yesterday!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We can do it later&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We can skip, he&amp;#39;ll be fine&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He won&amp;#39;t be fine. If I avoid walking him, he gets destructive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same issue now with diet journaling. At some point it became a &amp;quot;task&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m fighting with my grey matter every time I think I should log my food. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for the suggestions and commentary! I do think It&amp;#39;s a matter of making several decisions at once and assembling the whole task of what it means &amp;quot;to walk the dog&amp;quot;. Do I walk the whole neighborhood, half of it, or just around the block? Should I have a jacket, or can I manage without? Instead of all of that (maybe still need the jacket question) I should focus on &amp;quot;get the harness on the dog&amp;quot; because once he&amp;#39;s in it, we&amp;#39;re walking. \nAnother suggestion of finding a source of dopamine to look forward to is another good one I&amp;#39;ll look into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To those who effectively say &amp;quot;do it anyway&amp;quot; &amp;quot;have discipline&amp;quot;, etc...I want to punch you in the face for your self-righteous assholery. I&amp;#39;m not a machine. Fuck off. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I suffer from constant [akathisia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akathisia), [tic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_disorder), and \"severe ADHD\" ([their](http://www.rush.edu/) words), along with a host of related problems. Just dealing with these are fatiguing enough on top of life.\n\nTwo years ago I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Physics. I spent a year unable to find a job, but through sheer luck and a friend who nudged HR about my resume I now work with computers making 40k a year at an 8-5 salaried job. At work I fake it. Going on nearly a year now, nobody knows I have tic disorder or any neurological problems. I suffer through the akathisia, suppress the tics, force myself to pay attention, for 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, and during that time my job is essentially to make and enact complicated decisions. I have just enough willpower to make it until 5 o'clock.\n\nEach night when I get home I am utterly exhausted and depleted. I can hardly focus. I have trouble making as simple a decision as what to eat, and sometimes I simply don't. I often just lay down on the couch that I was thankfully able to afford (it used to just be the floor) and I don't even have the willpower to turn on the TV. There are bills piling up, things to get done, and the apartment is starting (only starting mind you!) to resemble something you'd see on the show Hoarders, if they hoarded piles of random stuff they lacked the willpower to pick up. I'm spending any remaining willpower I have just catching up in life, and I'm falling behind. I want to get ahead. I'm making the money to live an OK life but making that money takes away the willpower required to *live* that life.\n\nI want to get home and think \"what do I *get* to do tonight\" and **not** \"what do I *have* to do tonight\". How do I get there?\n\n\nFor those that wonder about medications, I have seen six doctors over four years and tried nine different medications, all with nasty enough side effects that they were not worth it. I used to not sleep at night at all, but I can at least do that now thanks to [clonazepam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonazepam).",

Having a goal with no habits supporting it is like having a destination but no way to get there\n&gt; Habits act as your vehicle to reach where you want to go. \n\nGoals need to be made with intention and be supported by habits. The **SMART** framework is commonly used in business and planning to define effective goals by making them specific, measurable, realistic, achievable and timebound. \n\n# **Specific**\nSpecific means creating your goals with a narrow scope to make them easier to follow. This helps you avoid **decision fatigue**, imagine you wanted to learn how to play piano, but when you sit down to start you think:\n&gt; I don't know what concept I should learn\n\n&gt; How long I should practice for? \n\n&gt; Where should I learn from?\n\nBy planning in advance we minimise the number of decisions we have to make in a willpower testing moment, and are much more likely to follow through.\n\nMaking your goals specific will also make them less vague as this make it easier to drop out or walk away, instead of just saying  :\n\n&gt; \"I'll run more often\"\n\nlook to create a more specific goal like \n\n&gt; \"I will run 4 kilometres twice a week\".\n\n# **Measureable**\nMeasurable is focused on tracking your progress and ensuring that you are **consistently improving**. It removes the need for subjective self-assessment amd helps you see what is working and what needs to be adjusted. \n\nObviously, some goals don't lend themselves well to being measured such as becoming better at singing or learning social skills, but the habits surrounding them usually can be:\n&gt; Spending an hour twice a week on vocal practice \n\n&gt; Making friendly conversation with a stranger once a day.\n\nIt can also help with motivation, by highlighting your past efforts and how much you have improved. From my experience learning Hindi it is very motivating to see the number of words I've learnt on Duolingo and how many hours I have put in.\n\n# **Acheivable**\nMaking your goals achievable is extremely important, it can be tempting to make crazy goals while feeling **temporarily motivated**. While that desire is important it can also lead to demotivation when you don't achieve them, even if the bar was set unreasonably high, going too big can also make it easier to create excuses later on and cause you to give up.\n\nA good way to ensure that your goals and habits are achievable is to:\n\n\\- Start small\n\n\\- Create a plan for how you will progress as you improve\n\n\\- Balance being ambitious and practical. \n\nRepetition is critical for building momentum, so even on days when you know you won't have time\n&gt; try and complete a partial version of the habit\n\nAs cliched as it is, **something is better than nothing**, so even if you can't write 3 pages of your book like you set out to, at least write 1. Avoid viewing habits as all or nothing.\n\n# **Realistic**\nRealistic is similar to achievable but is more focused on ensuring the goal is **important to you** Making your goals realistic is important because uncertainty about their value can create indifference and make them much harder to follow. Many successful people talk about the benefits of:\n\n\\- Learning a second language \n\n\\- Waking up at 6am everyday\n\nBut different habits work for different people, and while it's always good to try new things you should also be selective with your time and avoid starting habits just because they sound good or worked for someone else.\n\nYou should have a strong reason for starting a habit. This ensures your goals align with who you are and want to be. For example if you wanted to start meditating, you should ask yourself why? \n&gt; So you can have better focus at work? \n\n&gt; So you are calmer during confrontations? \n\nWhatever it is, have it make sense for you, as knowing this reason will help you remind yourself why it is important and give you the motivation to continue.\n\n# **Timebound**\nThis is fairly straightforward, just like a deadline on an assignment, creating a schedule for your habits will help prevent procrastination and let you actually start **now** rather than \"later\". It will also help you create time in your schedule to complete your habits, making them a priority instead of an afterthought.\n\nHaving a timeframe can help you deconstruct goals and habits to be smaller and more accessible so that you don't feel overwhelmed. **Success builds on success**, and building streaks on your habits over time, even if you start small will help you believe in your ability to reach your goals. \n\n\n\n**My Video where I go more in-depth on this**\n\n# https://youtu.be/nlbxjNHJcYQ",

This helps you avoid &lt;strong&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, imagine you wanted to learn how to play piano, but when you sit down to start you think:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what concept I should learn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long I should practice for? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where should I learn from?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By planning in advance we minimise the number of decisions we have to make in a willpower testing moment, and are much more likely to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making your goals specific will also make them less vague as this make it easier to drop out or walk away, instead of just saying  :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll run more often&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;look to create a more specific goal like &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will run 4 kilometres twice a week&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measureable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Measurable is focused on tracking your progress and ensuring that you are &lt;strong&gt;consistently improving&lt;/strong&gt;. It removes the need for subjective self-assessment amd helps you see what is working and what needs to be adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, some goals don&amp;#39;t lend themselves well to being measured such as becoming better at singing or learning social skills, but the habits surrounding them usually can be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spending an hour twice a week on vocal practice &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making friendly conversation with a stranger once a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can also help with motivation, by highlighting your past efforts and how much you have improved. From my experience learning Hindi it is very motivating to see the number of words I&amp;#39;ve learnt on Duolingo and how many hours I have put in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acheivable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making your goals achievable is extremely important, it can be tempting to make crazy goals while feeling &lt;strong&gt;temporarily motivated&lt;/strong&gt;. While that desire is important it can also lead to demotivation when you don&amp;#39;t achieve them, even if the bar was set unreasonably high, going too big can also make it easier to create excuses later on and cause you to give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good way to ensure that your goals and habits are achievable is to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Start small&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Create a plan for how you will progress as you improve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Balance being ambitious and practical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repetition is critical for building momentum, so even on days when you know you won&amp;#39;t have time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;try and complete a partial version of the habit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As cliched as it is, &lt;strong&gt;something is better than nothing&lt;/strong&gt;, so even if you can&amp;#39;t write 3 pages of your book like you set out to, at least write 1. Avoid viewing habits as all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realistic is similar to achievable but is more focused on ensuring the goal is &lt;strong&gt;important to you&lt;/strong&gt; Making your goals realistic is important because uncertainty about their value can create indifference and make them much harder to follow. Many successful people talk about the benefits of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Learning a second language &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Waking up at 6am everyday&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But different habits work for different people, and while it&amp;#39;s always good to try new things you should also be selective with your time and avoid starting habits just because they sound good or worked for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should have a strong reason for starting a habit. This ensures your goals align with who you are and want to be. For example if you wanted to start meditating, you should ask yourself why? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So you can have better focus at work? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you are calmer during confrontations? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, have it make sense for you, as knowing this reason will help you remind yourself why it is important and give you the motivation to continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timebound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is fairly straightforward, just like a deadline on an assignment, creating a schedule for your habits will help prevent procrastination and let you actually start &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &amp;quot;later&amp;quot;. It will also help you create time in your schedule to complete your habits, making them a priority instead of an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having a timeframe can help you deconstruct goals and habits to be smaller and more accessible so that you don&amp;#39;t feel overwhelmed. &lt;strong&gt;Success builds on success&lt;/strong&gt;, and building streaks on your habits over time, even if you start small will help you believe in your ability to reach your goals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Video where I go more in-depth on this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/nlbxjNHJcYQ\"&gt;https://youtu.be/nlbxjNHJcYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
