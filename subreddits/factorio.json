New to the subreddit, almost 1k hours playing Factorio.\n\nThis past year, I've decided I wanted to take on an overhaul mod and truly learn what it takes to create my own designs.  In vanilla, I had always copied someone else's blueprints and then modified them as needed.  I've started SE 4 times now, and got to other planets twice.  The first two times I gave up because I was spending all my time dealing with biters and got bored.  After turning them off, I built a small orbit station twice then landed on another planet only to grind to a halt with decision paralysis.  \n\nI think a part of it was that I've always built up my bases around a main BUS with trains only needed to grab RAW resources or supply the defensive wall.  With the introduction of so many new recipes and resources in SE I spent my entire time with my main BUS and did almost nothing in space.  My BUS got HUGE, I kept coming across bottlenecks, was redesigning the same recipes to fit in cramped spaces along the BUS, was tired of all the spaghetti, and changed my HUB a dozen times because I kept discovering new items that required telescoping recipes.  The moment I got to other planets, I got overwhelmed because I wanted a base designed around trains but didn't know where to start. \n\nThanks to a recent \\[meme\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Factoriohno/comments/162r19s/90\\_of\\_people\\_posting\\_their\\_base\\_online/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Factoriohno/comments/162r19s/90_of_people_posting_their_base_online/)) and Nilaus's self-building base video, I realized I had never done a true city block before. Maybe there's a reason they're so popular.  So these past few weeks I've been slowly designing a vanilla city block system.  It's been cathartic and frustrating in its own way, but I can see so much potential in it.  ATM I'm playing with biters off so space isn't an issue.  For all those extra resources and recipes in SE and future overhaul mods, I can just design a new city block and stamp them down if I need more instead of throwing more spaghetti at a BUS.  \n\nWith that rambling done, I have a few questions.   (Okay many questions)   The questions are aimed at both vanilla and overhaul mods in mind.\n\n\\- Am I being naive about city blocks helping me with decision fatigue?   How have city blocks helped y'all?  \n\n\\- What's an ideal train size?  I'm currently building around 1-4 trains in vanilla.  I used 1-2 trains for a while, but I kept having doubts about needing more belts and having too many trains on the rail network.  I heard SE ends up requiring less of each resource but I don't know if that's true.  I might build around 1-2 trains though for the smaller moons.    \n\n\\- Is there a good method for using multiple train sizes on the same network?   I imagine it might be helpful to start small because of limited resources at the beginning (such as on another planet in SE), then grow larger as your base grows.   I don't want each city block to have multiple train-sized outputs, but I have just enough circuitry knowledge that I can design a city block to take resources up and down train sizes if there's a shortage in one size or the other.  HOWEVER, I also don't want to wear out my decision-making with something like this.  But if there's a solution out there someone already found I might be interested.  \n\n\\- Best and worst corner intersection designs?   I used round-a-bouts at first because I heard forever ago those are very efficient for traffic IRL.  But I've had 2 jams with trains trying to go around each other and blocking the other off.  Then I realized Factorio is that perfect world (sorta) where cars (trains) can magically communicate with one another at intersections.  ATM I'm using X intersections with no-left turns.\n\n\\- City block sizes?  pros and cons for big and small?  I've currently settled on 100x100, with some being 100x200 or larger.  I keep avoiding larger city blocks because I don't like the aesthetic little factories inside a lot of space with lots of belts.  But I also suspect there are a lot of benefits to them I'm not considering. \n\n\\- Train queue stations?   All my designs in the past included 3+ train queues for each station.  But because city blocks have limited space, those queues end up taking up most of the space.  Can I get away with limiting 1 train per station or will that cause gaps in the resource belts?  \n\n\\- To chunk or not to chunk?  I tried so hard to develop around chunks this past month because I heard minimizing the chunks your buildings take up will give you minor UPS boosts when you have giant factories.  But because I had limited space within the blocks themselves I ended up ignoring the chunk boundaries too much.  Plus my blueprints would end up always requiring the Power Pole 32 mod.  ATM I'm not concerned about achievements but that expansion is around the corner. ",
