Our LO is 3.5 months old and the current issue constantly running through my brain is sleep, primarily naps. He is great at night. We put him to bed between 7:30 and 9 depending on how his wake windows/naps work out. He wakes up once to eat and then is usually up around 6. Actually he often wakes at 5:30 (either after sleeping through the whole rest of the night, or after a feed at 3:30) and doesn\u2019t want to go back to sleep, but that\u2019s manageable for us. After that, he takes 5 naps a day usually, sometimes 4.\n\nHere are some issues I would like to troubleshoot but can\u2019t prioritize in my brain:\n\n1. We rock him to sleep for all his naps and sleep, and I have no problem with that, but for some naps, he cries the whole time. As soon as he realizes what we\u2019re doing, he cries until he falls asleep. Usually takes 5 minutes or so of shushing and rocking. Why all the fuss? Are we missing something or does he just not like to fall asleep?\n2. He sleeps on one of us for 3-4 of his 5 naps because then he will sleep longer (70-90 minutes on average). In his bassinet it\u2019s 30-45 minutes. If we were to switch to all crib/bassinet naps, would he start taking longer naps, or would he end up having like, 7 naps per day because they\u2019re so short??? We don\u2019t really mind contact naps, but more and more often he has been crying between sleep cycles and crying himself awake, which he doesn\u2019t do in his bassinet. (But then again he does not connect sleep cycles in his bassinet during the day.)\n3. We also need to transition him to his crib and out of his swaddle because our free Snoo rental is ending soon. We don\u2019t put the Snoo on for his biggest chunk of nighttime sleep, so I don\u2019t think that will be a huge issue. I\u2019m more concerned about unswaddling because he\u2019s obsessed with his hands. He moves a lot in his sleep and I would be too worried he would roll over swaddled without being clipped into the Snoo, so they\u2019re mutually inclusive.\n4. Don\u2019t even get me started on drowsy but awake. I don\u2019t think he is able to do it, and it\u2019s the least of my concerns (although still something I manage to beat myself up about).\n\nIf you have specific advice or experience about any of these issues, I\u2019d love to hear it, but I know there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d answer. I\u2019m more venting about how overwhelming it can be to juggle all the choices about what is best for him. ",

My baby has obviously gotten much more alert and active and while this has been such a joy, I feel like my free time has completely evaporated. Every day feels the same, an endless loop of playing (boring) baby games, doing chores while baby plays alone or naps, going for a little mental health walk, and then balancing dinner/post dinner chores and bedtime with a husband that's always (annoyingly) exhausted from work and to my surprise since we became parents, he is not very helpful with bedtime and evening chores.\n\nI know it's a common saying but I feel I've got no hobbies or interests now, and I'm bored out of my mind, but also frustrated and overstimulated with the never ending tedious tasks. I feel like I'm bored, and I'm boring. My husband gets home from work and I don't really have anything interesting to share, I often don't get time to shower until after I put our son to bed, and trying to engage in a hobby like drawing or reading or working out during my sons 30 minute naps is almost impossible. \n\nI have done what I can to keep myself mentally and physically healthy. I go to a yoga class once a week, I try to listen to music or podcasts daily (but I never know what to listen to and I feel decision fatigue trying to figure it out, so I usually just listen to silence). I try very hard to get dressed and put minimal makeup on every day but this is even only starting to happen on good days. Im not watching anything because again, decision fatigue, but also because my son is very interested in screens already so im trying to keep it off all day long, especially because once my husband is from work its on until bedtime. I make plans with friends once or twice a week but I feel like I have nothing interesting to talk about, I can't focus on what people are talking about, and I am usually exhausted from these short social outings. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or solidarity here, but I guess I also feel I don't have anyone I can talk to about these feelings right now, hence why I'm here. When does it get better? As in, when can I actually have enough time to read a book, or workout, or do a hobby, or see a friend without thinking about my baby the entire time?",

Baby has been home for 3 weeks now and it\u2019s only me. My mom helps once a week so that I can go to work but right now that\u2019s it. I\u2019m so sleep deprived rn it\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nWhat would you ask for ? Any suggestions ? \nPerson checking in is a friend who knows my situation. Not a \u201cclose\u201d friend but close enough to care. \n\nTbh I hate this question, especially right now, I\u2019m already drained for the million decisions that I have made and have to continue to make for me and baby.. down to feeding myself that I am decision fatigued.. if I didn\u2019t have to make a decision for the next 3 days I would be happy &amp; why I told her I don\u2019t know what to ask for.. \n\nThis maybe just me but I would just pick something to do for them and do it.. I have a coworker/friend who also just had a baby. She shared with me her concerns and fears around BF, pumping, which formula to choose.. I put a box together for her with things that i have been using/ worked for me &amp; some encouragement/ snacks and sent it to her. Didn\u2019t ask her \u201cwhat she wanted\u201d she has enough to worry about then to think of one more thing.. idk I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is if you\u2019re not willing to put in the effort to assist mom/ you want mom to do the emotion labor of \u201casking\u201d for what she needs help with, then why bother asking!

Baby has been home for 3 weeks now and it\u2019s only me. My mom helps once a week so that I can go to work but right now that\u2019s it. I\u2019m so sleep deprived rn it\u2019s ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would you ask for ? Any suggestions ? \nPerson checking in is a friend who knows my situation. Not a \u201cclose\u201d friend but close enough to care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tbh I hate this question, especially right now, I\u2019m already drained for the million decisions that I have made and have to continue to make for me and baby.. down to feeding myself that I am decision fatigued.. if I didn\u2019t have to make a decision for the next 3 days I would be happy &amp;amp; why I told her I don\u2019t know what to ask for.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This maybe just me but I would just pick something to do for them and do it.. I have a coworker/friend who also just had a baby. She shared with me her concerns and fears around BF, pumping, which formula to choose.. I put a box together for her with things that i have been using/ worked for me &amp;amp; some encouragement/ snacks and sent it to her. Didn\u2019t ask her \u201cwhat she wanted\u201d she has enough to worry about then to think of one more thing.. idk I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is if you\u2019re not willing to put in the effort to assist mom/ you want mom to do the emotion labor of \u201casking\u201d for what she needs help with, then why bother asking! I know people mean well when they are making this statement but almost doesn\u2019t count \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
