I'm here because I really admire the spirit of this sub and I'm hoping to get some guidance from you fine folk on finding the right bag for an upcoming trip to Japan. I will be spending about 75 days there (April -  July). I'll be going from south to north (Okinawa up to Hokkaido) and traveling with my wife. I've been to Japan a couple times before for much shorter durations, but I've never traveled for this long before (anywhere). Let's call this a quarter-life crisis trip lol.\n\nI've been doing a lot of research on what bag would serve me best but I am having a hard time making a decision. I am leaning towards a TB Synik 30L because it seems to get universal praise, but I have also looked at various other bags (UA Dragonfly, MR Urban Assault, Go Ruck, some bags from REI, etc.) I have a Yeti 27L Crossroads bag now, but I'm not clicking with it. It's tough as nails but doesn't look good when it's lightly packed, the straps are sometimes uncomfortable, and the organization is lacking.\n\nHere are some things I am having trouble thinking through:\n\n* I am 6'5\" and 215lbs. I want a bag that will sit well on my frame and not look too big/small.\n* I also want to use this bag as an EDC for when we go on day trips from our hotel/air bnb.\n* Will be moving through a combination of urban, suburban, and rural areas.\n* Lots of commuting by public transportation (trains, subways, buses) and lots of walking.\n* I want the bag to offer security for my passport, money, other docs, etc. for peace-of-mind which in my head means interior zipper pockets (e.g. TB Synik 30L has lots of great organizational pockets but they are all exterior access, which for me feels like increased risk even though it's Japan. I\u2019m more afraid of dropping something than pickpockets). \n* There's probably no way around the clunky aesthetic of a stuffed backpack, but would be a nice bonus.\n\n**Do you think the Synik 30L is a good choice? Do you have other recommendations for bags that would excel for this use case? Do you have any general recommendations for an inexperienced long-term one-bag wannabe traveler like myself lol (rookie mistakes to avoid, Japan-specific things to think about)l?** \n\nP.S. Full transparency -- this will be a one bag trip with an asterisk because I need to bring a small roller bag to carry some medical stuff.\n\nThank you everyone!!!",

The lighter the better, but I'm to sacrifice a little bit of weight for comfort such as back padding\n\n**Qualities I'm looking for:**\n\n* Back + shoulder comfort is a must!\n* External water bottle pockets\n* Padded laptop compartment\n* Sternum strap + waist strap (removable/stowable would be preferable)\n* Some loops for carabiners/trekking pole attachment\n\nPacks I've been agonizing over:\n\n[**Topo Designs Core Pack**](https://topodesigns.com/collections/end-of-season-sale-bags/products/core-pack?variant=6939178762293)**- $64**\n\n* Dimensions: 13\"w x 18\"h x 8.5\"d\n* 25 L\n* 2.8 lb\n\nPros:\n\n* 2 water bottle pockets\n* Very spacious + bright inner lining\n* Adjustable load-lifters and sternum strap + removable waist belt!\n* Looks very comfortable to wear\n* Aesthetically pleasing to me. Not too many bells and whistles, yet functional\n* Can stand up on its own\n\nCons:\n\n* My primary worry is that it's too big/bulky looking for my small frame (I haven't been able to find any pictures of shorter women wearing this pack)\n* Sounds like back panel can run be a bit hot. No mesh/padding in the back\n\n[**Tortuga Setout Laptop Backpack**](https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/setout-laptop-backpack)\n\nSpecs:\n\n* Dimensions: 18.5\u201d x 12\u201d x 6.75\u201d\n* 25L\n* 2.8 lbs \n\nPros:\n\n* Found one for $75!\n* I've heard the straps are VERY comfortable and there's good airflow in the back\n* Smaller profile but can still carry a bunch; professional looking\n\nCons:\n\n* Only 1 water bottle pocket; don't care much about the side grab handles \n* No waist strap, but maybe I can DIY my own\n\n[**Osprey Aphelia**](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/aphelia-APHELIAF19.html) **+** [**Osprey Questa**](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/questa-QUESTAF19.html)\n\n* Aphelia: 18.52h x 11.82w x 9.85d\n* Questa: 18.52h x 13w x 10.24d \n* 26 L\n* Aphelia: 1.54 lbs\n* Questa: 1.63 lbs\n\nPros: \n\n* Cheaper than Topo and Tortuga: Aphelia $49.5; Questa $44.5\n* Aphelia's airscape back panel looks very comfortable and good air flow\n* Sternum + waist strap\n\nCons: \n\n* 1 compartment only has 1 direction zip\n* Not sure if the compression strap will hinder the opening of the compartments\n\nThe Aphelia and Questa seems very, very similar, which adds to my indecision. \n\nAs you can see, all the packs listed look really good, but I am unable to try them out in person, so if anyone has any comments, dislikes of packs, please let me know! \n\nThanks!",

My older brother and I will be spending most of our time in civilization and take week-long treks occasionally over the course of our trip. Hoping to pack as light as possible and fit everything in a carry-on. I\u2019m 18, female, 5\u201911\u201d, and 125lbs. \n\n- Not really sure of the size of backpack I should get, which I think is an important starting point. \n\n- I\u2019m planning to pack a sleeping bag, but am unsure of what else to bring in terms of a sleeping setup and other gear for the trail (sleeping pad, tent, cooking/eating stuff, etc), as I know items can be rented. \n\n- In terms of shoes, I\u2019m planning to bring hiking shoes (open to suggestions), Nike Free Runs for running + the city, and flip flops/sandals (also open to suggestions\u2014does anything beat Chacos?). Thoughts on this plan?\n\n- Will my Patagonia Nano Air suffice as my only mid-layer? Planning to bring my Arcteryx Shashka for my shell. \n\n- Looking for items like the Prana Halle Pant (can anyone tell me if these pants are comfortable enough to sleep in?)\u2014technical gear that performs on the trail and looks good in the city. Looking for shorts and shirts as well (need to be able to run in them). \n\n- What are your thoughts on buying gear used through eBay/Craigslist? Is it worth the money you save?\n\nI\u2019m really open to any and all suggestions and advice! I\u2019ve borrowed stuff for every backpacking trip I\u2019ve taken in the past, so I\u2019m getting pretty much everything I\u2019ll be taking with me now. Exciting but also daunting and I\u2019m experiencing some crazy decision fatigue. Thank you so much in advance.",

Looking for suggestions of versatile items I can use in both the backcountry and the city, as well as advice in general. My older brother and I will be spending most of our time in civilization and take week-long treks occasionally over the course of our trip. Hoping to pack as light as possible and fit everything in a carry-on. I\u2019m 18, female, 5\u201911\u201d, and 125lbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really sure of the size of backpack I should get, which I think is an important starting point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m planning to pack a sleeping bag, but am unsure of what else to bring in terms of a sleeping setup and other gear for the trail (sleeping pad, tent, cooking/eating stuff, etc), as I know items can be rented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of shoes, I\u2019m planning to bring hiking shoes (open to suggestions), Nike Free Runs for running + the city, and flip flops/sandals (also open to suggestions\u2014does anything beat Chacos?). Thoughts on this plan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will my Patagonia Nano Air suffice as my only mid-layer? Planning to bring my Arcteryx Shashka for my shell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for items like the Prana Halle Pant (can anyone tell me if these pants are comfortable enough to sleep in?)\u2014technical gear that performs on the trail and looks good in the city. Looking for shorts and shirts as well (need to be able to run in them). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on buying gear used through eBay/Craigslist? Is it worth the money you save?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m really open to any and all suggestions and advice! I\u2019ve borrowed stuff for every backpacking trip I\u2019ve taken in the past, so I\u2019m getting pretty much everything I\u2019ll be taking with me now. Exciting but also daunting and I\u2019m experiencing some crazy decision fatigue. Thank you so much in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
