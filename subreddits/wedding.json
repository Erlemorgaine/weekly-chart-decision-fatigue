I don't like doing big things for my birthday, I don't like public praise at work, I don't like PDA from my partner. It makes me feel downright uncomfortable and slightly anxious. My baseline of anxiety is probably a little higher than the average person's but I've put a lot of work and time in therapy into managing it.\n\nI just got home from my bach trip and am so upset that I couldn't get out of my head enough to enjoy it. I was stressed for days leading up to it and that didn't get better during the trip. I did not like being the center of attention and having to make every single \"little\" decision of the weekend- I worked with my MOH to plan out the itinerary and bigger activities but as most brides are during their special weekend, was peppered with little things like \"Do we want to order apps for the table? Which one? What music do you want to listen to while we get ready? Which drinking game do you want to play?\" etc. \n\nThe decision fatigue was exhausting and just made me anxious. Not all of my bridesmaids knew each other and I have different relationships with them and wanted to ensure that everyone had a good time. I'm grateful that I have girls who want to ensure I'm having a good time but having to be consulted for every little thing was exhausting and in a weird way made me feel like I had no control over the weekend. \n\nAdditionally, I felt almost guilty that we were doing things focused on me all weekend. I had two bridesmaids that have different tastes in trips and while they were polite and active participants, I could tell this wasn't their speed. We had so much liquor and food left over and I feel guilty that my girls \"wasted\" money on me. They wouldn't let me buy my own drinks at the bar- I had to pull my credit card out of my friend's hands bc was tired of having to ask someone for a drink every time I wanted one. \n\nI know that all of this came from a good spot- my MOH is a very anxious person and I could tell this trip stressed her out but she was so committed to making sure that I was having a good time. I am SO grateful for all that she did to plan the trip and so grateful that my friends used their PTO and traveled pretty far to go on this trip. \n\nHowever, I'm worried that the rest of my \\~ bridal era \\~ will make me feel the same. I physically feel like crap and as I'm sitting here writing this, I have the worst Sunday Scaries I've had in a while. My MIL and mom are both waiting on me to give them dates that I would be available for showers and engagement parties and while I am so grateful for them to throw something like this for me, I'm scared that I'm going to be anxious during them. \n\nI also feel like I'm not doing the \"bridal era\" right because I don't enjoy these activities- I feel guilty and anxious about people feeling obligated to do these things for me. \n\nEven more so, I'm terrified that I'm going to spend the entire weekend of my actual wedding stressed tf out, worried that everyone's not enjoying themselves, and/or regretting having a bigger wedding/feeling guilty that people are spending their time and money to travel to our wedding.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I feel like a crazy person especially reading and re-reading this but need some assurance that other non-center of attention brides were able to actually enjoy their weddings. I am head over heels in love with my fiance and am so excited to marry him and celebrate with all of our friends. I just can't get out of. my own head when the spotlight is on me and me alone. \n\n\n\n",
