But I was at work in the field and couldn\u2019t get to an office to fill out the paperwork that was only accessible on desktop. (The district has to approve each form, etc etc.)\n\n\nFigured no big deal, I could do it tomorrow when I set up my desktop to print. But the next day, LO\u2019s teacher announced \u201cunfortunately, all chaperone spots have already filled. Parents that would still like to come, must drive themselves and pay their own entry, here\u2019s the link to *that* form.\u201d \n\n\nThat\u2019s fine, I thought, I can still go. It\u2019s an hour drive away; I\u2019d just drive by myself so my kid could enjoy riding the bus to and fro. \n\n\nAs I thought out logistics (we have 50/50 custody and field trip is not on my week), I noticed as comment after comment popped up from other parents, \u201c*Form submitted*.\u201d, \u201cAlready approved!\u201d, \u201c*We\u2019ll be there. Form submitted for me and my husband*.\u201d\n\n\nWe\u2019re talking at least 15 parents now, including the chaperones. Is this common?! Would I be suffocating my kid now if I went too?\n\n\nI felt a bit deflated but submitted my form anyway. Tried to remind myself, I\u2019m not IN traffic, I AM the traffic. I get it. But I can\u2019t help to also feel\u2026 fatigued. \n\n\nIf I\u2019m not getting the SOLD OUT pop-up for concert tickets, I\u2019m seeing \u201cOut of Stock\u201d, No Vacancy, Add to Waitlist at every turn. \n\n\n- An indie vocalist I wanted to see? Sold out in 6 hours while I was at work. \n\n- Basic cotton sweater at Sam\u2019s Club? Sold out while in my online basket. \n\n- A cabin by a lake, 3 months in advance? No vacancies through November. \n\n- Petite sizes? - sold out, not just Small, but Medium and Large, too. \n\n\nThank goodness I\u2019m not in the market to buy a house because don\u2019t even get started on that\u2026\n\n\nFrom cheap items (entire stock of Nyx and other brands at Ulta sold out in store) to expensive experiences ($3,000 early bird tickets to a 3-day metal festival + hotel), the race to GET THERE FIRST before it\u2019s sold out - the constant sense of scarcity against a crowd feels like the Twilight Zone.\n\n\nMaybe this sounds like a non-issue to some, but *really the point is*  I\u2019m wondering is anyone else is feeling like this?? \n\nWhere getting excited for anything feels like a false start\u2026",
