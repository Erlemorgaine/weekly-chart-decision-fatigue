I called Home Master to ask them if it's still usable (idk shit about anything) and they're like \"Nah bro, you need to toss that tank and the whole system, bacteria and shit probably growing in there now.\" \n\nAlright cool, I'm not buying another RO system from them.\n\nThis sent me down the rabbit hole of researching every possible brand and model there is and I have complete decision fatigue.\n\nI know there are many threads here recommending different systems for different requirements, but I'm at my wit's end. I can't decide on what I need and just need someone to tell me.\n\nI don't care about tankless vs tank or water flow rate. It's just me, my wife, and a dog. What I want is clean AF water + remineralization that I can actually trust is doing what it claims. I want as much flouride, PFOs, VOCs, chromium, cadmium, microplastics, et-FUCKING-cetera, removed from my water.\n\nIt's more important to me to have more / higher NSF certifications than the install (although fuck you Home Master and your complicated ass system) or the frequency and cost of filters. I will gladly pay a little bit more knowing that my water is legit and not poisoning me.\n\nThe Waterdrop G3P800 is nice, but it's hella expensive. I don't really want to pay that much, am more comfortable in the $500 range.\n\nI've watched so many youtube reviews, read so many articles, read my local water report like 15 times. \n\nPlease, r/WaterTreatment - you're my only hope. Tell me what to buy.\n\nEDIT: I thought about just putting something on my counter, but we don't have much counter space so under the sink is the move.",
