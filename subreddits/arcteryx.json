The primary use will be for snowboarding at resorts (Canada, great lakes area); but would be nice to have an option to wear it around town on weekends during the winter months.\n\nI went to my local Arcteryx store this past week to look at some options but would appreciate some input to help with my decision.\n\nI am evaluating the options of either:\n\na) insulated jacket\n\nb) insulated mid-layer + shell\n\nMy current set up is base layers + maybe a hoodie or North Face zip up fleece before my current insulated jacket. Having said that, it is probably a good opportunity to improve my current set up.\n\nI do like the idea of Option A as it will just be one jacket and its similar to my current set up of base layers + fleece + thicker jacket.\n\nHowever, I am open to Option B as it might be an improved approach and provides flexibility. With Option B; however, comes a bit of decision fatigue. I am also starting from scratch when it comes to building a \"closet\" to meet multiple scenarios.\n\nIf I chose Option B, are there any recommendations for the combination? When I was in the store, the Atom does not seem to be super thick and I am concerned that I may not be warm enough even with a shell - might be unwarranted but just some thoughts.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",
