My first ever Reddit post :)\n\nI\u2019ve never owned a desktop (other than using my parents\u2019 tower as a kid), and love laptops for their form factor and all-in-one ability.  Been on PlayStation forever, no huge desire to move to PC gaming other than casual and/or simpler games (KSP, CSGO, Minecraft\u2026). My old HP ENVY 13 is dying, and couldn\u2019t really run what I wanted anyways.\n\n So I\u2019ve found a huge interest in the MiniPC world, with the hopes that I can satisfy my casual gaming/browsing desire while staying on a budget (and keeping my small desk area free). However, I\u2019m suffering from horrible hyperfixation and decision fatigue\u2026 :) please help me.\n\nMy requirements:\n- budget of $400 but bonus points for $300\n- no pure-efficiency core CPUs (I want my base clock to be &gt;2GHz)\n- Ryzen 5 or greater (always done Intel but I\u2019m hearing AMD is the way to go now?)\n- series 5000 or greater (but I\u2019ve heard 7000 has driver compatibility issues?)\n- good quality (least likely to just die on me, good WiFi, simple audio setup, minimal screen flicker)\n- be able to play KSP1 on low/mid settings, but maximum complexity with minimal lag/frame drop.\n\nGiven all this - and my multi-week rabbit hole of going back and forth - I think the SER5 MAX Ryzen 7 5800H is my best bet? Seems reliable, good specs, cheap enough on AliExpress.\n\nI also looked extensively at the Minisforum UM560XT. But it\u2019s slightly lower specs for a similar price. Just not sure on reliability.\n\nThoughts?",
