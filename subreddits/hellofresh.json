I was the primary only meal planner and cook in my family of seven for 25 years and was OVER it. Enter HF! Here's what I loved and why I stayed with it for 2 years:  \nLOVED:  \n-**Ease** of the app.  \n-The **food**. 90% of the time, the food was very good.  \n-**Cooking**. I learned to cook things in new ways and use ingredients I had yet to consider using together.  I enjoyed that part.  \n-No more **decision fatigue**  \n-**Easy clean up** (HF reduced the amount of waste over the 2 years I subscribed)  \n-**Customer service**. I see a lot of people have bad experiences, but mine have been good. Even great. Above and beyond every time. They've refunded me without question when a bag had damaged ingredients. They've given me credit for the trouble of some glitches. I use the chat feature primarily and never had a bad experience.\n\nI'M LEAVING BECAUSE:  \n-**Pork**. I don't like that 75% of the options are pork. I don't want to pay more if I prefer turkey, chicken, or beef.  \n-**Carrots**. Seriously. So many carrots and potatoes. I don't want to pay more for broccoli.  \n-**Prep.** If I'm going to pay for this service, I don't want to spend time chopping and chopping. I'll be looking for something as near ready-to-cook as possible.  \n-**Weight discrepancies**. You lovely Redditors clued me in to the weight problem so I weighed the meat this time.[(see video)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3kwVrAH9SfbdDVDT8) That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.\n\n**Did HF save me money over those two years?** Yes. I paused several times, determined to meal plan and prep for the family, but that part of my life is over. So we end up ordering out or making expensive Costco runs. Also, it was worth paying more for the meals to be decided and the shopping done for me. I use curbside for other grocery shopping, which still requires planning, decisions, and time. It was totally worth paying HF to do that for me.\n\nFor now, we will make a few of our favorite simple dinners and buy some ready-made meals from Costco Deli (shepherd's pie, chicken cordon bleu, salads, chili, Asian frozen foods) and Trader Joe's. If any of you have recommendations on where I should go after this, let me know! If HF addresses some of these issues, I'd consider returning some day.\n\n\\[edited to add a correct link\\]",

                    "selftext": "I've been a HF \"user\" for several years now. And by that I mean: I've download and printed a hundred-ish recipe cards and sourced ingredients myself, making substitutions where necessary.\n\nBecause of this sub, and various other places I've seen super horrid reviews, I never pulled the trigger on the actual delivered meal kit. Until recently. Had a friend with a really good discount over a few boxes, so I interrogated them about their thoughts on the kits.\n\nI'm going to give a little insight into where I live so you'll understand why I was super hesitant to join in the first place. I'm basically in the middle of buttmunch nowhere Indiana. In my town of 12000 people, we have a Kroger, Save a-lot (formerly an IGA) and a WalMart HOMETOWN store (If you've never heard of that, its because we have one of literally the last two left in the whole state. It does NOT have a grocery section. Minimal fridge and freezer space. Nothing fresh.) For food we have your blue million fast food joints, roughly 8 pizza places, no less than 4 Mexican joints, three bars and other trash deep fried food. (Everywhere has the \"best\" tenderloin sandwich \\*eyeroll\\*)\n\nThe nearest town with a Meijer or a WM Supercenter is 20 minutes away.\n\nI had no idea where my shipments would come from and who would be delivering them. The reason: We don't even have uber in this town. We just recently got DoorDash, but only a few restaurants use it because of the fees. We have 100 DD drivers though \\*shrug\\* No Amazon deliveries either, they still go through USPS here.\n\nI knew from previous experience with Imperfect Foods that those deliveries came out of a hub near Chicago and were delivered FedEx (always looked like they used them to play hockey or even rugby with). This was a scary thought for HF deliveries. Eggs would never make it with FedEx at the helm. Turns out, I get my HF box delivered from a hub in Hodgkins Illinois, so probably the same place Imperfect comes out of, but it's delivered via UPS. Three for three have been delivered with almost zero damage (one had eggs in it too).\n\nAll of my meals have been intact and my free items have been included. There was one \"missing\" free item, but it was a fail UP with HF doing the improvement on the fail. I was supposed to get the avocado and pineapple salsa toast, but instead got the guac and eggs sandwiches. I didn't even submit a claim, because, they failed up. I got one very small sweet potato for the hoisin meatballs, but I just added a white potato. I probably could have made the sweet potato work for us. Also did not submit a claim for that.\n\nI'm only doing two meals per week for two people and so far it's been exactly enough food for us both. I probably could have made three meals out of the pasta dishes, but we both liked them and ended up eating all of it in one go.\n\nThe reason I decided to pull the trigger now is because despite us being in such a small town, we still have to deal with big city prices, credit card fees and everything else that goes with dining out. One HF box is cheaper than one dinner out. Even without a discount!\n\nGrocery shopping isn't much cheaper. I usually spend on average $250 for two weeks, not including the gas to get to Meijer and back. Half the time, I don't even end up cooking what I bought, it just goes into the freezer for some other time. I find that HF gives me motivation a couple days a week to actually cook. Kind of force myself, in a way, because it all comes in fresh and I don't want to waste it. Plus the decision fatigue is taken away. It's one of two, not one of everything I have on hand.",

And by that I mean: I&amp;#39;ve download and printed a hundred-ish recipe cards and sourced ingredients myself, making substitutions where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this sub, and various other places I&amp;#39;ve seen super horrid reviews, I never pulled the trigger on the actual delivered meal kit. Until recently. Had a friend with a really good discount over a few boxes, so I interrogated them about their thoughts on the kits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to give a little insight into where I live so you&amp;#39;ll understand why I was super hesitant to join in the first place. I&amp;#39;m basically in the middle of buttmunch nowhere Indiana. In my town of 12000 people, we have a Kroger, Save a-lot (formerly an IGA) and a WalMart HOMETOWN store (If you&amp;#39;ve never heard of that, its because we have one of literally the last two left in the whole state. It does NOT have a grocery section. Minimal fridge and freezer space. Nothing fresh.) For food we have your blue million fast food joints, roughly 8 pizza places, no less than 4 Mexican joints, three bars and other trash deep fried food. (Everywhere has the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; tenderloin sandwich *eyeroll*)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nearest town with a Meijer or a WM Supercenter is 20 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea where my shipments would come from and who would be delivering them. The reason: We don&amp;#39;t even have uber in this town. We just recently got DoorDash, but only a few restaurants use it because of the fees. We have 100 DD drivers though *shrug* No Amazon deliveries either, they still go through USPS here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew from previous experience with Imperfect Foods that those deliveries came out of a hub near Chicago and were delivered FedEx (always looked like they used them to play hockey or even rugby with). This was a scary thought for HF deliveries. Eggs would never make it with FedEx at the helm. Turns out, I get my HF box delivered from a hub in Hodgkins Illinois, so probably the same place Imperfect comes out of, but it&amp;#39;s delivered via UPS. Three for three have been delivered with almost zero damage (one had eggs in it too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of my meals have been intact and my free items have been included. There was one &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; free item, but it was a fail UP with HF doing the improvement on the fail. I was supposed to get the avocado and pineapple salsa toast, but instead got the guac and eggs sandwiches. I didn&amp;#39;t even submit a claim, because, they failed up. I got one very small sweet potato for the hoisin meatballs, but I just added a white potato. I probably could have made the sweet potato work for us. Also did not submit a claim for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only doing two meals per week for two people and so far it&amp;#39;s been exactly enough food for us both. I probably could have made three meals out of the pasta dishes, but we both liked them and ended up eating all of it in one go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I decided to pull the trigger now is because despite us being in such a small town, we still have to deal with big city prices, credit card fees and everything else that goes with dining out. One HF box is cheaper than one dinner out. Even without a discount!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grocery shopping isn&amp;#39;t much cheaper. I usually spend on average $250 for two weeks, not including the gas to get to Meijer and back. Half the time, I don&amp;#39;t even end up cooking what I bought, it just goes into the freezer for some other time. I find that HF gives me motivation a couple days a week to actually cook. Kind of force myself, in a way, because it all comes in fresh and I don&amp;#39;t want to waste it. Plus the decision fatigue is taken away. It&amp;#39;s one of two, not one of everything I have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
